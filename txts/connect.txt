Executive summary
The promise of 5G has captured the attention of business leaders, policy makers, and the
media. But how much of that promise is likely to be realized anytime soon?

With the first true high-band 5G networks already live, we set out to take a realistic view
of how and where connectivity could be deployed and what it can enable over the next
10 years. But 5G is not appearing in isolation. This research takes a more expansive view
of connectivity to include other technologies, ranging from fiber and satellites to Wi-Fi and
short-range technologies.

Despite the hype about remote surgery and Star Trek–style holodecks in everyone’s living
rooms, the future is not solely happening on the frontier. Existing connectivity technologies
are expanding and evolving, with new standards that boost network performance—and they
are much less capital-intensive. We have identified an enormous array of use cases that can
run on this type of upgraded backbone. Companies do not have to wait for high-band 5G to
implement new systems and go after the resulting productivity gains.

To illustrate what is possible, this research looks at how connectivity could be deployed in
mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. The use cases we identified in these four
commercial domains alone could boost global GDP by $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030. This
implies that the value at stake will ultimately run trillions of dollars higher across the entire
global economy.

Most of this value can be captured with advanced connectivity, using technologies that have
been available for some time now. This raises a puzzling question: Why is so much potential
still sitting on the table, and will new technologies alone be enough to realize it? This research
looks at the issues holding back the market, with the aim of starting a broader conversation
about what it will take to create momentum. It is part of an ongoing body of work that will
continue exploring connectivity, including its possibilities in other sectors and its impact
across broader economies.

Beyond the implications for industry, connectivity also has ramifications for equity and
society. A picture of today’s digital networks superimposed on the planet would confirm that
the World Wide Web is not actually worldwide today. There are dark gaps as well as regions of
unusual density. In the decade ahead, many of those blank spaces will light up, and billions of
new users will come online.

Enabling more people to plug into global flows of information, communication, and services
could add another $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion to GDP, above and beyond the economic value of
the use cases identified in the four commercial domains highlighted in this research. Although
gaps will remain, this trend could unlock greater human potential and prosperity in many
developing nations.

                                    Existing connectivity technologies are expanding their reach as networks are built out and
                                    adoption grows. At the same time, the next generations of these technologies are appearing,
                                    with upgraded standards (Exhibit E1). Both of these trends are expanding and improving what
                                    we refer to as “advanced connectivity.” In addition, a new type of more revolutionary (and
                                    more capital-intensive) “frontier connectivity” is emerging, although it is likely to have a more
                                    limited geographic footprint in the decade ahead, barring the mass-market deployment of
                                    satellite coverage.

                                      evolve, from backbone networks to the last mile that meets the end user. In networks, for
                                      instance, providers are upgrading existing 4G infrastructure with low- to mid-frequency

    “non-standalone” 5G network overlay.1 The results of these upgrades will vary significantly
    depending on the spectrum used and density of supporting infrastructure such as cell
    towers. But in general, these low- to mid-frequency 5G networks can offer significant
    improvements in speed and latency while supporting a greater density of connected
    devices. Meanwhile, fiber optic networks continue to expand, and the introduction of
    the new DOCSIS 3.x standard promises to bring the performance of cable broadband
    closer to that of fiber—and to do so over existing infrastructure. In the last mile of access,
    the next generation of Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6) will improve speeds while supporting many more
    connected devices. Technologies that use radio signals for tagging, tracking, and
    contactless short-range communication between devices (such as Bluetooth, NFC,
    and RFID sensors) are becoming more sophisticated. Low-power wide-area networks
    (LPWANs, with competing standards such as LoRa, NB-IoT, and SigFox) provide
    connectivity over broader areas and longer ranges. All of these technologies continue to
    improve in terms of affordability, functionality, and adoption.

— Frontier connectivity: Frontier technologies like high-band 5G and low-earth orbit
  satellite constellations represent a more radical departure.2 Designed to be the most ultra-
  fast mobile option, high-band 5G (often in the form of standalone 5G) promises to put the
  speed, latency, reliability, and security of fiber in the air, expanding what mobile devices
  can do. It offers a significant step change in overall network performance from low- to
  mid-band 5G. Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites could also deliver a breakthrough—not
  necessarily in network performance but in breadth of coverage. By essentially beaming
  broadband down from space, they could bring coverage to remote parts of the world
  where the economics do not work for laying fiber or building cellular towers. However,
  providing ubiquitous coverage requires a constellation of many satellites orbiting at once,
  making viability uncertain. OneWeb and SpaceX are the only companies to launch test
  satellites (as of this writing), and no commercial services are yet available.

The advances described above are occurring alongside an expansion of hardware and
software capabilities. 3 Cloud computing will provide a processing backbone and storage
capacity for use cases that require significant computational power. Edge computing will do
the same while removing latency limitations. The new architecture of connectivity will also
include private corporate networks. These connectivity and computing advances will enable
cheaper and much more efficient “thin” devices connecting with the cloud and localized
servers; they could become mainstream at the end of the decade for both consumers
and businesses.


Advanced and frontier connectivity will enable new capabilities in major
commercial domains
Today consumers still power the internet. Online video accounts for some 70 percent of the
world’s internet traffic, with only small differences across regions. By 2030, we expect that
share to exceed 80 percent. By some estimates the world will consume 20 times more data
than it does today, with much of this growth driven by new users, more time spent watching
video, and higher-definition content. 4

Connectivity will enable businesses to do more in the next decade as well.5 Enhanced
broadband will make streaming, downloads, and data exchange lightning fast. Because they

    require less power, LPWANs can extend the battery life of the devices and sensors they
    connect, making it viable for the Internet of Things to scale up like never before. Ultra-low
    latency and strong security will create the confidence to run “mission-critical” applications
    that demand absolute reliability and responsiveness—even in vital infrastructure systems and
    in matters of life and death. LEO satellites could provide true global coverage.

    Based on industry-specific research and expert interviews, we have identified hundreds of
    use cases in commercial domains that would run on both advanced and frontier networks.
    These are independent of the many consumer-driven entertainment and internet applications
    that are possible. To convey the sheer diversity of use cases, as well as some of the
    opportunities and implementation challenges, we profile four commercial domains with some
    of the largest potential to capture higher revenues or cost efficiencies.6 The use cases we
    describe in this research are meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, and others will
    likely emerge over time.

    — Connectivity will be the foundation for increasingly intelligent mobility systems.7 While
      the automotive industry is at the heart, mobility is a broader concept that includes car-
      sharing services, public transit, infrastructure, hardware and software, and more—in
      short, all of the actors and enablers involving in moving people (and goods) from one
      point to another on the ground. Connectivity could open up new revenue streams
      through preventive maintenance, improved navigation and carpooling services, and
      personalized “infotainment” offerings. Vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle
      communications can prevent collisions, enable various levels of vehicle autonomy,
      and improve traffic flow. We estimate the GDP impact of connectivity in mobility to be
      $170 billion to $280 billion by 2030.

    — Connected devices and advanced networks could transform healthcare. 8 Low-latency
      networks and high densities of connected devices and sensors make it possible to
      monitor patients at home in real time, which could be a major boon in the treatment of
      chronic diseases. Data can flow seamlessly throughout entire medical systems to smooth
      operations and coordinate care. AI-powered decision support tools can make faster
      and more accurate diagnoses, and many tasks can be automated so that caregivers can
      spend more time with patients. The ability to aggregate and analyze enormous data sets
      could yield new treatments. Together these use cases could free up additional investment
      capacity in healthcare and generate $250 billion to $420 billion in global GDP impact
      by 2030.

    — Manufacturing and other advanced industries can run highly precise operations using
      low-latency and private 5G networks.9 Smart factories powered by analytics, artificial
      intelligence, and advanced robotics can run at maximum efficiency, optimizing and
      adjusting processes in real time—not only on select assembly lines but across multiple
      plants. A growing number of factories will incorporate features such as automated guided
      vehicles and computer-vision-enhanced bin picking and quality control; these functions
      require the kind of speeds and ultra-low latency that high-band 5G networks provide. The
      GDP impact of connectivity in manufacturing could reach $400 billion to $650 billion by
      the decade’s end.

    — Retailers can use sensors, trackers, and computer vision to manage inventory,
      improve warehouse operations, and coordinate along the supply chain. Connectivity
      can support frictionless in-store experiences—for example, eliminating checkout
      and adding augmented reality for better product information. Real-time personalized

        In addition to illustrating the range of use cases, these domains were chosen as a large, representative cross-section of
        the economy. They include both industrial and consumer-facing businesses, with a diverse mix of assets, occupations,
        and geographic footprints, and they span many different supply chains.

                                      recommendations and promotions can increase sales. Some innovative retailers have
                                      already begun experimenting with and implementing some of these use cases, and
                                      advances in technology and affordability should lead to broader adoption by the decade’s
                                      end. These use cases in retail could boost GDP by $420 billion to $700 billion.

                                 Building a more connected world could create substantial economic
                                 value, mostly enabled by advanced connectivity
                                 The use cases we identified in the four commercial domains described above could boost
                                 global GDP by an estimated $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030 (Exhibit E2). This would be
                                 equivalent to 3.5 to 5.5 percent of the expected GDP in these domains.

                                 These use cases (and the capabilities related to enhanced broadband, the IoT, and mission-
                                 critical applications) are relevant in other domains as well.10 Next-generation inventory
                                 management, for example, has applicability beyond retail; it also has value for logistics
                                 and consumer goods companies. Use cases that improve equipment utilization in factories
                                 also apply in mining, oil and gas, and commercial real estate operations. Over and above
                                 the value generated in the four domains described in this research, use cases running on
                                 advanced and frontier connectivity could generate trillions of dollars in value across the entire
                                 global economy.

                                 There are additional economic benefits to businesses, consumers, and society that are not
                                 captured in this analysis. They include, for instance, the ability for businesses to differentiate
                                 themselves by creating a rich customer experience; the benefit of having better health




                                 10
                                      On 5G specifically, several papers make the point that the economic potential is linked to business use cases and cross-
                                      industry relevance. See, for instance, The road to 5G networks: Experience to date and future developments, OECD
                                      Digital Economy Papers, No. 284, July 2019; and The 5G economy: How 5G technology will contribute to the global

    outcomes and healthier, more productive citizens; and the ability to reduce waste and better
    manage capital and natural resources in production processes.

    In the four domains we studied, advanced connectivity can enable some 70 to 80 percent
    of the economic potential. A great deal can be achieved without investing in frontier
    connectivity. This is because even in the wealthiest economies, only a relatively limited set of
    leading companies are deploying the most ambitious use cases that can run even on today’s
    networks, from sensor-enabled inventory management to logistics tracking. As connectivity
    improves and hardware and applications become more affordable and mainstream, there is
    much more room for adoption to spread across domains, driving bigger productivity gains.

    By contrast, use cases that require frontier connectivity such as high-band 5G could
    eventually generate some 20 to 30 percent of the potential impact, based on the use cases
    we have sized. High-band 5G will create greater network efficiency, boosting speeds and
    lowering latency even as providers accommodate more consumer-driven traffic and more
    devices. Existing use cases can run on a bigger scale while becoming more sophisticated and
    reliable. For example, these capabilities could open the doors to deploying tens of thousands
    of infrastructure sensors in a dense urban area, streaming data to consumer vehicles and
    public institutions securely in real time to enable safety features and faster emergency
    response.11 It is possible that the value of use cases running on frontier connectivity could
    exceed our estimates, depending on whether some high-potential but still speculative use
    cases like augmented reality and self-driving vehicles reach mass adoption by decade’s end.
    A stronger digital backbone can also support new applications we cannot predict today. The
    extent to which these developments—and the related demand—actually materialize will likely
    have a meaningful impact on the deployment and adoption of frontier connectivity.

    In addition to the potential in these four commercial domains, advances in technology,
    coverage, and affordability can bring more of the world online. Aging or inadequate networks
    will be upgraded in future investment cycles, while new digital networks will reach some
    regions for the first time. Today 40 percent of the global addressable adult population is
    still under-connected (in other words, not yet using 3G-capable data networks or better) or
    altogether offline due to inadequate coverage, affordability barriers, or insufficient relevance
    (such as content in the local language). By 2030, that share could be cut in half. This will be
    enabled by a combination of trends, including not only wider network coverage but also the
    growing affordability of devices and data plans, the development of more relevant internet
    content, and demographic and social shifts (like increasing urbanization rates). This newly
    online population will benefit from intermediate connectivity via 3G or 4G/LTE cellular
    networks for basic web browsing, consumer mobile phone applications, e-commerce, and
    online video.12 Global GDP could increase by another $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion as a billion
    people gain better access to digital information, tools, and services.

         We use the term “intermediate connectivity” to refer to access to 3G and 4G/LTE cellular networks (with speeds of 1 to
         50 Mbps and latency of ~50 milliseconds or more). Compared to advanced and frontier connectivity that we defined
         previously, intermediate connectivity features different technical capabilities, supported applications, and subscriber
         populations.

                                      To realize the full value at stake, persistent issues need to be solved
                                      The growth of connectivity is a development with substantial promise—and as noted above,
                                      most of it can be achieved using technology that already exists today. While this is grounds for
                                      optimism, progress has yet to take off. In a world where future economic growth depends on
                                      improving productivity, the hurdles slowing both connectivity investment and the widespread
                                      adoption of use cases urgently need to be addressed. While the barriers vary somewhat in
                                      each commercial domain that we analyzed, many of the issues can be categorized into five
                                      groups (Exhibit E3).

                                      — Value chain coordination: Multiple players across an ecosystem may have to cooperate
                                        in order to implement a given use case.13 Many have never collaborated before, but they
                                        will need to work together on issues such as agreeing on technical standards. In mobility,
                                        for instance, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle warning systems involve
                                        public infrastructure providers, rival automotive manufacturers, connectivity providers,
                                        technology players, and equipment manufacturers. All must align on technical standards
                                        in the hardware for the system to work—but standards are still evolving, even in the most
                                        developed markets.

                                      — Use case fragmentation: The value at stake from enhanced connectivity is substantial
                                        when viewed cumulatively across the entire economy, but it requires aggregating many
                                        small pockets of potential across hundreds of use cases and domain participants.
                                        Connectivity use cases are not always core priorities for participants, especially those
                                        who are not as far along in their digital transformation journey. All of this can contribute to
                                        companies taking a “wait-and-see” approach or stalling in never-ending “pilot purgatory.”
                                        Retailers and manufacturers, for example, could both benefit from advanced computer
                                        vision, but the value it could produce may not be significant enough for companies in these
                                        sectors to create strong demand for someone to deliver these services right away. In such
                                        cases aggregators may be needed to create enough viable scale in demand.
                                                                     ES and
                                      — Misaligned incentives: This is the familiar monetization question. The actor assuming the
                                                                     report
                                        cost and risk of investment (and doing the heavy lifting of implementation) in a domain may
                                        not be the one who captures the ultimate financial gain. In healthcare, for instance, several
                                        connectivity-enabled use cases have the potential to increase efficiency and improve
                                        health outcomes. But while hospitals and health providers may be the ones to make such

     investments, train workers, and change their day-to-day operations, the financial benefits
     may accrue to health insurers or consumers. Similarly, consumer internet, media, and
     advertising companies have long profited from offering “over-the-top” services that run
     on networks built and maintained by connectivity providers, but the providers themselves
     have struggled to monetize this activity in a proportional way.

— Data complexity: Many use cases require data sharing across firm and industry
  boundaries. But standards to ensure privacy, security, ownership, and interoperability are
  still evolving.14 Protecting data is paramount for both companies and consumers to guard
  against ever-evolving risks. In addition, machine-to-machine transmissions (for example,
  between a hospital’s health informatics system and a patient’s home health monitor,
  or between equipment in a remote production plant and an operations hub) requires
  interoperability between IoT systems.

— Deployment constraints: Some of the issues holding back progress include physical
  barriers slowing network enhancement and use case adoption. Connectivity providers
  and domain users alike may have an extensive legacy asset base that will be expensive
  to upgrade. Regulatory uncertainty also needs to be resolved around broad issues
  as well as domain-specific questions in areas such as mobility and healthcare. For
  connectivity providers, practical constraints like spectrum availability, access rights to
  public infrastructure, and power density limits are persistent challenges that often have
  to be overcome at the local level. Even among commercial customers such as retailers,
  manufacturers, or wholesalers, adopting connectivity-enabled use cases can be delayed
  by long capital investment cycles. In the past decade, many firms have postponed asset
  upgrades due to weak growth and an uncertain investment outlook.15

These are thorny issues that cannot be solved by technological advances alone. But they are
also not insurmountable challenges. Fragmentation presents an opportunity for an actor—
whether government, connectivity providers, tech giants, or industry coalitions—to play a
coordinating role. Likewise, current business models may have to evolve to allow for more
cross-sector partnerships, realignment of incentives, and risk sharing. In most countries,
governments can play a coordinating role or set standards, but the private sector will shoulder
most of the weight of forming smoothly functioning ecosystems.


The development of connectivity and the geographic distribution of
economic value will be uneven
Even if the market issues described above are resolved, connectivity will not be uniform
across different regions. Deployment will be influenced by each market’s revenue potential,
its existing telecom infrastructure, its urban density, and local market dynamics including
competition and regulation. Connectivity providers’ own ability to undertake and monetize
major capital investment is crucial. Another consideration is the evolution of demand and its
distribution across users, applications, and geographies. As a result of all these factors, the
business case for deploying advanced connectivity, and especially frontier connectivity, looks
very different across markets.

The evolution of connectivity will vary across four country archetypes
We define four country archetypes based on differences in revenue dynamics, such as
average revenue per user and level of data usage; cost dynamics, such as the quality and
extent of existing telecom infrastructure as well as urban density; and market dynamics,
including differences in regulation and competition. Based on these characteristics, we
classify countries as being pioneers, leaders, followers, or trailing in connectivity today. We
consider China and India as two unique cases in addition to these four archetypes.

     The countries that are out in front today can continue to expect superior performance
     and new capabilities that may remain out of reach for years for the countries that trail in
     connectivity today (Exhibit E4). The countries that stay in the forefront of connectivity could
     have a first mover’s advantage and position themselves to be the innovators.

     These four sets of countries are progressing along the connectivity continuum at varying
     speeds and are likely to continue to do so:

     — “Pioneers,” including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have consistently led
       the pack in connectivity. They are already beginning to deploy high-band 5G networks
       in cities, taking advantage of mature fixed infrastructure and the relatively strong capital
       positions of their providers. In these markets, competitive dynamics are forcing providers
       to race ahead.

     — “Leaders,” typified by markets such France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, are
       consistently close behind the pioneers. But operator investment may be constrained in
       these markets since price competition has reduced margins.

     — “Followers,” such as Brazil, Poland, and Turkey, are starting with less adept infrastructure,
       and their providers will find it hard to support the large capital investment needed to build
       more sophisticated networks. They are expected to lag a few years behind in deployment,
       especially for frontier connectivity, which will likely be limited to major urban cores only.

     — “Trailing” markets, such as Pakistan, Bolivia, and many African nations, are unlikely
       to gain widespread advanced or frontier connectivity in the near term. Although LEO
       satellites may provide connectivity options in these markets (and in rural areas of
       follower markets), the cost of deployment and the affordability of user devices will be
       limiting factors.

     In addition to the four archetypes above, China and India retain their unique status:

     — China has poured huge investment into its fixed and cellular networks for the past several
       years. It is building out this backbone at a faster rate than any other country, with the aim
       of offering 5G in all major cities and switching a quarter of mobile subscriptions to 5G
       by 2025.

     — India is digitizing faster than any trailing market. Although it is rapidly modernizing mobile
       networks, they are likely to have performance limitations outside of a few major cities. The
       country’s connectivity providers have come under pressure from price wars, and it will
       likely take price increases or government action to spur buildout.

     Over the next decade, connectivity providers will continue to build and upgrade networks, but
     the rate of progress will vary across these archetypes, with pioneers and China consistently
     leading the pack.

     Advanced connectivity—in particular, advanced connectivity that relies on mobile networks, in
     the form of low- to mid-band 5G coverage—could reach as much as 80 percent of the global
     population by decade’s end. This would come at a cost of some $400 billion to $500 billion.
     Yet significant gaps will remain. While coverage rates might exceed 90 percent in most of the
     world, they will likely reach only around 60 percent on average in trailing countries.

                                     Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                                        11


     Advanced connectivity that relies on fixed networks is a different story. Today, pioneer
     countries and China enjoy very high fiber coverage rates relative to the rest of the world,
     due in large part to various private- and public-sector investments. In the years ahead,
     connectivity providers may not have a strong business case to expand fiber coverage
     further in many markets without subsidies from governments or other third parties. Without
     additional investment, fiber coverage is not likely to grow substantially in many parts of the
     world, although it could more than double in follower markets as they pursue catch-up growth.
     Overall, we estimate that fiber coverage rates could reach 90 percent or higher in pioneer
     markets and China, 65 to 70 percent in leader and follower countries, and 5 to 10 percent in
     trailing markets and India by 2030.

     Frontier connectivity (that is, high-band 5G) drives the required investment much higher,
     creating a tougher business case to do so on a comprehensive scale. Yet in certain dense
     urban areas with very high per capita data consumption, providers may find that the network
     efficiency benefits alone justify deployment. Covering roughly a quarter of the world’s
     population by the decade’s end would require some $700 billion to $900 billion. While
     China and pioneer markets are projected to cover up to 55 percent of their populations,
     the corresponding share is projected to reach 35 percent in leader markets, 30 percent in
     follower countries, and 10 to 15 percent in trailing markets and India.

     Despite the fact that huge populations stand to gain coverage for the first time, the digital
     divide that separates urban and rural populations and trailing countries from the rest of
     the world appears likely to persist in the decade ahead. If LEO satellites are successfully
     deployed, they have the potential to change the game and almost erase the gap. Yet they
     remain a wild card—and other barriers such as readiness and the affordability of devices and
     data plans would need to be addressed in addition to coverage.

     Where will the value associated with these use cases flow?
     Some $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion is at stake in mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail
     alone. But the pie will not be divided evenly across country archetypes (Exhibit E5).16
     These differing outcomes stem from the expected availability of advanced and frontier
     connectivity—and the coverage gap will be especially pronounced for frontier connectivity.

     In terms of advanced connectivity use cases, we estimate that 60 to 65 percent of the value
     could go to pioneer markets and China, 20 to 25 percent to leader markets, 10 to 15 percent
     to followers, and 5 percent to India and trailing countries.17 The share going to China and
     pioneers would slightly exceed their expected weight in the global economy in 2030, while
     the share going to India and trailing markets would fall below. Leader and follower markets
     stand to make gains that are largely in line with the share of global GDP they are expected
     to generate.

     For use cases running on frontier connectivity, the dispersion of value is more striking. We
     estimate that 70 to 75 percent would go to China and pioneer markets, 15 to 20 percent to
     leaders, 5 to 10 percent to followers, and only 2 to 5 percent to India and trailing countries.
     China stands to capture an outsized share that could be 40 to 50 percent higher than its
     share of global GDP, while the share going to pioneer markets could be 20–30 percent
     higher. The story is not as positive for the rest of the world. Leaders might capture a share
     that is 20 to 30 percent lower than what the expected size of their economies would indicate.
     Followers might punch 30 to 40 percent below their weight, while trailing countries and India
     could capture a share of the anticipated value that is 70 to 80 percent below their share of
     global GDP.


     16
          We estimate this distribution based on each archetype’s GDP share, its current and expected evolution of fixed and
          wireless connectivity, its urban density, and the demand for use cases and their economic viability in the region.
     17
          It should be noted that significant value and GDP gains are possible in India and trailing markets from a range of use
          cases enabled by the expansion of intermediate connectivity, along with foundational digital identification infrastructure
          and digital payment systems. See Digital India: Technology to transform a connected nation, McKinsey Global Institute,
          March 2019; and Digital identification: A key to inclusive growth, McKinsey Global Institute, April 2019.

                                    Unlike the value produced within commercial domains, approximately half of the $1.5 trillion
                                    to $2 trillion associated with bringing a larger share of the population online could be
                                    concentrated in India, trailing countries, and follower countries. This is because the
                                    affordability and network availability gaps that can be closed over the next decade are most
                                    prevalent in these types of countries. An additional one-third would stem from China.

                                    The question of how to monetize usage has dogged connectivity providers (notably telecom
                                    operators) in previous technology cycles, and now the same issue threatens to carry over into
                                    the next. It will not be resolved solely through investing in new networks. Those networks will
                                    create major opportunities, but it will take new strategies to capture them.

     The road for many connectivity providers has been rocky in recent years, and it does not look
     much smoother in the decade ahead. Build-outs and upgrades will demand major investment
     at a time when mature markets are saturated, and competition is leading to price wars.
     Many providers will struggle to find the required capital and make investments pay off with
     conventional revenue models. In some countries, competitive pressures or regulation are
     forcing connectivity providers to plunge ahead with buildouts and upgrades even before the
     economics have become clear.

     Connectivity providers that have already invested heavily in laying digital infrastructure
     foundations will likely be able to maintain stable ratios of capital investment to earnings even
     as they continue with their rollouts. But the pressure will be acute for those that have not yet
     invested heavily and now find themselves facing a game of catch-up with new technologies.
     Those outside of pioneer markets and China will collectively need to find significant additional
     annual revenue growth to deliver adequate returns to their shareholders while continuing to
     cover the costs of advanced connectivity upgrades—let alone frontier networks.


     Our research raises more questions about the future of connectivity
     Our research to date has surfaced a number of questions and uncertainties that require
     further investigation.

     First, as connectivity providers face the need to sustain major capital investment, what kind
     of new business models might emerge? Can providers form partnerships to share the costs
     of deployment? Network sharing has proven successful with previous generations of cellular
     connectivity, and it could reduce the cost of 5G deployment.18 Further, can providers partner
     with businesses in other domains to create viable long-term strategies, potentially taking a
     bigger role in developing innovations such as connected vehicles, remote healthcare, or the
     Internet of Things?

     A second set of questions revolves around what types of new players might become
     connectivity providers, from tower and infrastructure companies to tech giants. To what
     extent will companies across industries opt to build their own private networks, and who will
     own that space? How likely is it that today’s traditional telecom operators will continue to
     provide the backbone of connectivity architecture for years to come? What about in the “last
     mile” of connectivity services? LEO satellites in particular remain a wild card; it is still unclear
     if their offerings will gain traction and become profitable. If so, they could dramatically expand
     capacity and intensify pricing pressure throughout the industry.

     Beyond infrastructure implications for connectivity providers, the broader technical
     architecture is changing within specific domains. Enhanced connectivity may open
     opportunities to rethink where and how computing happens, especially when combined with
     advances in computing (such as cloud, edge, and quantum computing), device and sensor
     efficiency, storage, and software design. Connectivity providers and technology companies
     alike are already hurrying to identify potential new offerings, as evidenced by Amazon and
     Verizon’s recent 5G Edge computing partnership.19 These changes could have meaningful
     implications for the full technical stack of companies and across entire domains.

     Another set of questions relates to consumers. Consumer media and entertainment accounts
     for most of the capacity usage—yet the demand is skewed by a small share of consumers,
     and providers have had a hard time monetizing this usage. Will this trend continue, or will new
     applications change this dynamic? The research suggests that 2 billion new consumers will
     come online over the next decade. Will they follow the same pattern?

A related area, which we will explore in future research, centers around use cases in other
commercial domains. How much more economic value can they generate? How different are
their use cases from the ones considered in this research, and can most of them similarly be
executed using currently available technologies? Beyond the barriers to adoption identified in
this research, do other domains have additional, specific issues due to their market dynamics,
incentives, or regulations?

Lastly, the role policy makers will take in shaping the connected world of the future remains
unclear. To date, governments around the world have taken markedly different approaches
in facilitating the expansion and evolution of connectivity. In some markets, governments
have played a very hands-on role through direct investment and subsidies for connectivity
providers. Some are investing heavily in R&D. Others are taking a more hands-off role,
simply facilitating the broader connectivity market through actions like spectrum auctions. In
addition to these levers, regulations on topics such as spectrum sharing and power density
will have major implications for where, when, and how the value of enhanced connectivity will
be realized.



Advanced and frontier connectivity will give companies in every domain a powerful new
platform for innovation and productivity. The full range of new use cases that can be
developed on top of this digital backbone will become apparent in the decade ahead,
including some that we cannot imagine today. Turning all of this potential into reality depends
on whether connectivity providers, end users in multiple domains, and public officials can
forge new models and clear away some of the barriers. The world could soon be more
connected—setting the stage for both innovation and disruption along the way.




Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                        15


     1. Changing how the
        world connects
       The days of dial-up, when the internet moved at a glacial pace, are now a distant memory.
       Today technology heeds our commands at the touch of a button. But even in the wealthiest
       countries, the digital world is not as fast and responsive as it could be. Calls still drop,
       connections go down, large files fail to download, and videos freeze for buffering.

       All that is about to change, and quickly, thanks to the next generations of fixed and mobile
       connectivity as well as the proliferation of some existing technologies. More than any single
       advance on its own, it is the convergence of these developments that could enable new
       capabilities and create a more connected world.

       In the coming years, connections could be 10 times faster, with a new level of reliability and
       stability.20 As latency improves by up to 50 times, applications will respond seamlessly to
       commands. Consumers could enjoy instant high-definition video streaming and even new
       types of immersive experiences with augmented and virtual reality.

       Improved connectivity will provide a platform for every domain to boost productivity and
       innovate, running a remarkable diversity of applications. Adding up use cases across all
       domains, we see trillions of dollars in untapped potential—and a great deal of it does not
       require waiting for the most capital-intensive mobile networks to be built.

       The spread of advanced connectivity technologies with stronger capabilities, as well as the
       debut of frontier connectivity, will have significant implications for the way we communicate,
       do business, and consume entertainment and information. The rest of this report will consider
       trends and scenarios in demand, capital investment, and rollout. It will also preview use cases
       in mobility, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing to illustrate what businesses can do on top
       of this backbone. The world’s connections are set to branch out, extending to more people,
       places, and devices, across more geographies, than ever before.


       Connectivity technologies are taking strides forward
       The world’s connections are about to expand and improve rapidly in the years ahead, making it
       possible for users to run more sophisticated applications. While the debut of ultra-high-speed
       5G networks has commanded a great deal of attention, a quieter but still-powerful evolution
       has been taking place. We distinguish between two types of connectivity: advanced and
       frontier (Exhibit 1). See also Box 1, “What is possible with advanced and frontier connectivity?,”
       for more on the types of capabilities each one supports.

       Advanced connectivity
       Existing connectivity technologies are penetrating more broadly across geographies and
       domains. At the same time, the newest standards are making them more robust.

                                    In terms of mobile coverage, providers are upgrading existing 4G infrastructure with low- to
                                    mid-band 5G network overlay. The end results of these upgrades will vary depending on the
                                    spectrum used and tower density. But in general, these low- to mid-frequency 5G networks
                                    can offer significant improvements in speed and latency, all while supporting a greater density
                                    of connected devices.21 On the fixed side, fiber optic networks continue to expand. The
                                                                 ES and
                                    introduction of the new DOCSIS 3.x standard also promises to bring the performance of cable
                                    broadband closer to that of fiber—and to do so over existing infrastructure.
                                                                 report
                                    Once a location is wired with fiber, the next generation of Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6) will improve speeds
                                    while supporting many more connected devices. Wi-Fi 6 will make the biggest difference
                                    in crowded environments such as airports, apartment buildings, theaters, stadiums, public
                                    spaces, and homes with multiple internet users and smart gadgets. It also extends the battery
                                    life of smart devices and IoT sensors by employing “target wake time,” which recognizes
                                    higher data transmission times instead of continuously scanning for signals. Users need to
                                    have Wi-Fi 6-ready devices, however.

                                         Low- to mid-band 5G can achieve speeds ranging from 100 to 300 Mbps, while latency can be reduced below
                                         50 milliseconds. This type of 5G network is sometimes referred to as “non-standalone.”

     Technologies such as Bluetooth, NFC (near-field communication), and RFID (radio frequency
     identification) rely on radio signals. In rough terms, RFID enables one-way contactless
     communication between devices, while NFC is a newer form that can support close-range
     two-way communication. RFID is already widely used in logistics, while NFC is still emerging.
     Bluetooth enables data exchanges between fixed and mobile devices using radio waves and
     building personal area networks. These technologies have applications such as package
     tracking, security access, contactless payment, and sharing from one phone to another.

     Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) provide connectivity over broader areas and
     longer ranges.22 Different protocols, such as LoRa, NB-IoT, and SigFox, compete in this realm,
     with no clear winner at this stage.23 Since LPWANs require less power from the devices they
     connect, they could enable batteries in those devices to last 10 years or more.24 This could
     set the stage for billions of additional battery-powered devices and sensors to come online.
     Beyond network developments, IoT sensors themselves are becoming more sophisticated
     and robust. They can perform more complex tasks, from location tracking and temperature
     measurement to small-scale processing. Even as they gain capabilities, unit prices are
     rapidly declining.

     Frontier connectivity
     Frontier technologies like high-band 5G and low-earth orbit satellite constellations represent
     more radical departures.

     High-band (also known as millimeter-wave or standalone) 5G networks represent a step
     change in performance.25 Designed to be the most ultra-fast mobile option, high-band 5G
     promises to put the speed, latency, reliability, and security of fiber in the air, expanding what
     mobile devices can do.26 Because this requires a highly densified radio access network, an
     upgraded 5G core network, and upgraded network support systems, these networks are
     highly capital-intensive to build.27 Users will also need to upgrade to 5G-capable devices in
     order to experience the full benefits. Some companies will connect to commercially available
     services, while others may opt to build their own private 5G networks.

     Like 5G, LEO satellites enable other technologies, but their viability is less certain.28 If
     successful, they could deliver a breakthrough—not necessarily in network performance
     but in breadth of coverage. They could cover parts of the world where the economics do not
     work for laying fiber or building networks of towers (although providing coverage requires a
     constellation of many satellites orbiting at once). LEO satellite constellations could potentially
     substitute for mobile backhaul in disadvantaged or remote areas, essentially beaming
     broadband down from above, and providing coverage to those who lack connectivity today.
     The next generation of LEO satellite constellations promise substantial improvements over
     versions launched in the 1990s. However, OneWeb and SpaceX are the only companies to
     launch test satellites (as of this writing), and no commercial services are yet available.29


     Cloud and edge computing will also be major elements of the new
     connectivity architecture
     Improvements in connectivity are not happening in isolation. New and upgraded networks will
     enable and be used in conjunction with other key technologies—most notably cloud and edge

     Box 1.
     What is possible with advanced and frontier connectivity?

     Later in this report, we look through the lens of a few commercial domains to describe
     some of the use cases that become possible when advanced and frontier networks are
     put in place.

     Advanced connectivity technologies will offer a range of use cases generating
     efficiencies and value. In mobility, for example, cars will be able to connect and “talk” to
     each other in real time, thanks to short-range connections as well as low- to mid-band
     5G. These live flows of data could help prevent collisions while smoothing the flow of
     traffic. Large transit hubs like airports will be able to provide fast, reliable Wi-Fi 6 to
     thousands of travelers at once, with optimized power consumption.

     Frontier connectivity technologies come into play with use cases that demand more
     in terms of speed, volume of transmitted data, latency standards, and density of
     connections. In manufacturing settings, for example, automated machinery and
     vehicles, robots, and sophisticated user devices such as augmented reality headsets
     will run on lightning-fast high-band 5G, or a private network equivalent, to adapt the
     production environment dynamically. LEO satellites can provide coverage to otherwise
     difficult-to-cover areas, supporting new use cases in logistics and agriculture, for
     example. They could also serve as the primary connectivity solution for the aviation and
     maritime industries.




computing. Together these advances will enable some of the most data-hungry applications
of the future.

Cloud computing will continue to provide a processing backbone for use cases that require
high computational power, storage capacity, and advanced data analytics capabilities. This
computing is essential for everything from storing videos to training artificial intelligence
programs. Without a boost from cloud computing, user devices might not be able to run the
most cutting-edge applications enabled by enhanced connectivity—or they would need to be
far more expensive.

Edge computing aims to address some of cloud computing’s limitations on several fronts. 30
Instead of transmitting data to central cloud servers that could be located hundreds or even
thousands of miles away from the end user, edge computing brings computational power,
storage, and networking closer to the physical location where the data is being generated
or consumed. 31 The actual computing could then occur in smaller-scale data centers on the
outskirts of major cities (the metro edge), at the base of radio access network base stations
(the micro edge), in wiring closets on the end user’s own premises (the edge gateway), or even
on the device itself that generates data (the edge device).

Several trends are fueling the desire to bring processing and storage closer to the end user.
The first is the proliferation of connected devices, especially as the Internet of Things is
deployed in more environments. According to a recent IDC estimate, there could be up to
42 billion connected IoT devices by 2025. 32 These devices are also becoming more complex,
evolving from basic smart devices to smart connected systems and processes. With a greater
number of more complex devices comes an exponential increase in the amount of data being

     generated—one that could exceed what a centralized cloud can absorb, especially as IoT
     applications rely more heavily on ultra-high-definition video and audio processing. This, in
     turn, creates a proportional need for efficient storage that ensures data security.

     Another key driver in the growth of edge computing is the demand for real-time analytics,
     decision making, and adjustments. These capabilities are critical for applications such as
     augmented and virtual reality, connected cars, drones, video monitoring, and remote control
     of industrial machinery. This need for the most minimal of latencies makes it advantageous to
     avoid transmission time back to the cloud.

     In addition, application development is shifting toward new solutions like container-first
     architecture, microservices architecture, and serverless computing platforms. 33 These
     solutions offer lightweight and portable alternatives for running applications on the edge,
     enabling developers to conduct testing and maintenance faster and more effectively. Finally,
     edge computing answers a critical need from industrial players operating transportation
     and logistics networks or remote factories. Now they can access computing, storage,
     and analytics resources in environments with intermittent or limited connectivity or even
     extremely remote areas.

     All of these drivers point to growing adoption of edge computing worldwide. While it took 10 to
     15 years for cloud computing to reach maturity, edge computing is on a faster trajectory. 34
     The cloud ushered in a paradigm shift that changed software and computing power from
     products that are owned to services that are delivered. Edge computing could be viewed as
     an extension of this evolution towards a more decentralized model. Today much of the focus
     is on figuring out the architecture (particularly emerging industry standards for application
     development and maintenance, and for interoperability between the edge, devices, and the
     cloud). Once it emerges, adoption could rapidly accelerate.

     Investment in this new processing layer is likely to be supported by players across the broader
     connectivity ecosystem. 35 Providers can benefit from the presence of an edge computing
     layer to increase the efficiency of their networks through centralized radio access networks
     (C-RAN), to deploy private networks for corporate customers, and to offer innovative services
     such as network slicing. For hyper-scale cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Google
     Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, edge computing is an opportunity to expand their cloud offerings
     for a higher quality of service at lower cost. Co-location providers like Equinix and Digital
     Realty can lease additional capacity to their customers and expand their market shares
     by setting up more data centers. Network equipment manufacturers can further pursue
     the market for end-to-end private wireless network solutions, either independently or in
     partnerships with connectivity providers.


     Technologies and their increasing affordability will put greater
     capabilities into the hands of more users
     It is useful to think of connectivity as a continuum, with multiple stages: basic, intermediate,
     advanced, and now frontier. 36 Each stage reflects improvements in both speed and latencies,
     and other benefits (such as energy and spectral efficiency, and the density of connected
     devices that can be supported). Advanced and now frontier connectivity are setting a new

     36
          Basic connectivity involves sunsetting technologies such as 2G cellular, dial-up, and L-band LEO satellites. Intermediate
          connectivity can be provided by 3G and 4G cellular networks (with speeds of 1 to 50 Mbps) and by DSL and GEO
          satellites (with speeds of 0.5 to 50 Mbps). Latencies with basic connectivity are greater than 50 milliseconds. Advanced
          connectivity can be provided with low- to mid-band 5G cellular networks (with speeds of 50 to 300 Mbps) and fiber /
          DOCSIS 3.x (with speeds above 100 Mbps and latency of less than 10 milliseconds). Latencies with advanced connectivity
          are less than 50 milliseconds. Frontier connectivity comes from high-band 5G cellular networks (with speeds above 300
          Mbps and latency of less than 1 millisecond) and next-generation LEO constellations (with speeds of 50 to 200 Mbps) and
          fiber / DOCSIS 3.x (with speeds above 100 Mbps and latency of less than 10 milliseconds).

standard. Many (but not all) wealthier economies are moving well along this continuum, while
much of the developing world is still playing catch-up. 37

Yet connectivity is likely to take a step forward even in those parts of the world where it may
not be viable to build high-band 5G networks. 38 Coverage roughly on a par with what affluent
countries and major cities enjoy today will spread to more parts of the world. Adding to the
momentum, prices are continuing to decline for sensors and for storage and computing
capabilities (Exhibit 2).

As these developments converge, domains will gain new capabilities and more of the world
will come online:

— Enhanced broadband: Enhanced broadband will make entertainment streaming lightning
  fast. Factory workers can use augmented reality glasses for quality inspections. Retailers
  will be able to deliver personalized promotions, augmented reality product information,
  and frictionless checkout using computer vision in stores.

— Massive Internet of Things: Low-power networks and the falling cost of sensors set the
  stage for the IoT to scale up like never before. It can deliver precision irrigation to crops
  in the field or monitor mining and drilling operations at remote sites. Dense networks of
  sensors embedded in the urban environment could monitor public infrastructure systems,
  accelerate emergency response, and improve traffic flow.

— Mission-critical services: Ultra-low latency and improved stability will create the
  confidence to run applications that demand absolute reliability and responsiveness. Some
  of these involve the lifeblood of a business, but others are literally matters of life and
  death, such as vital infrastructure systems.

— Near-global coverage: If LEO satellite constellations realize their potential, it will
  be possible for businesses to connect on a truly global scale for the first time. They
  can reach new consumer markets and integrate far-flung parts of the value chain. In
  addition, near-global coverage would enable remote environmental monitoring and
  disaster management. It could also greatly broaden the reach of telemedicine and digital
  education, beaming critical services to disadvantaged regions.


The connectivity ecosystem now has many players
The entry of new players is reshaping the connectivity ecosystem. Some are known, while
others are still emerging. While competition is ratcheting up on all sides, four of the many
sources of pressure on traditional telecom companies are over-the-top streaming services,
tech giants, infrastructure and tower companies, and satellites.

Connectivity providers are being challenged by new players who directly compete with
their services, from cable providers to e-commerce companies. WhatsApp seized on
improvements in earlier generations of connectivity to capture part of the traditional provider
market. Digital giants such as Netflix and YouTube have introduced “over-the-top” services
that run on the network infrastructure built by traditional telecoms—but the telecoms have
largely missed out on those revenues.

                                     The portfolios of tech players and connectivity providers have begun to overlap. Tech players
                                     have introduced operator-like services (such as Apple’s iMessage and Google Fi, which is
                                     an MVNO service). 39 At the same time, operators have moved into traditional tech markets
                                     such as data centers. In a world where edge computing and distribution are becoming
                                     more important parts of the value chain, the computing space will be a strategic place to
                                     capture value.

                                     Another potential challenge for connectivity providers comes from network infrastructure
                                     providers and independent tower operators (towercos). As more companies with industrial
                                     production sites and large-scale corporate complexes see the value of having their
                                     own dedicated infrastructure, private campus networks could become an increasingly
                                     valuable piece of the connectivity market by decade’s end. This could effectively cut
                                     traditional providers out of the loop. Furthermore, as towercos become bigger players,
                                     they could expand horizontally into traditional operator areas such as backhaul or small
                                     cell deployment. 40

                                     Conventional providers could face another challenge looming (literally) overhead, as more
                                     LEO satellite constellation companies prepare to take their services mainstream. 41 If LEO
                                     operators can overcome their technical barriers and challenges related to upfront capex and
                                     business models, they could capture a significant share of organic growth. Whether they can
                                     do so is yet uncertain (see Box 2. “Among new competitive challengers, satellites are a wild
                                     card”). Some of the fundamental issues around capital investment, risk, and revenue sources


                                     39
                                          A mobile virtual network operator, which is a wireless service provider that does not own the underlying infrastructure but
                                          rather leases capacity from a mobile network operator.

that affected the previous generation of satellite networks in the late 1990s may resurface
with the new generation.



   Box 2.
   Among new competitive challengers, satellites are a wild card

   As with all new technologies, it is still unclear if LEO offerings will gain traction and
   become profitable. According to US Federal Communications Commission filings,
   satellite density in lower orbits should triple by 2030.

   One scenario would see LEO operators achieve competitive data pricing that makes
   their service attractive to consumers. Three developments, alone or in combination,
   could make this possible: venture capital funds making heavy investments and allowing
   for long investment cycles; social investors continuing to step in; and governments
   offering public support and regulatory accommodations. If LEO operators obtain
   sufficient support and are able to surmount their technical barriers, they could capture
   significant organic growth in new and low-coverage markets from conventional
   providers. This would also add even more capacity in an already highly supplied market,
   creating pricing pressure that could dampen operator revenues.

   In another scenario, an oversupply of intermediate connectivity could make revenues
   unsustainable, particularly in combination with technical difficulties in capacity
   planning, transmission, and handset power requirements. If LEO operators hit all these
   roadblocks, they would have little to no effect on the consumer market for conventional
   providers. Their service would be too expensive for all but a premium niche of customers
   in remote areas with high connectivity needs (such as cruise ships, research stations,
   and remote resorts).




How all these new providers will shape market structure remains to be seen. The role
governments play will also influence the connectivity markets of the future. Future spectrum
costs could potentially increase capital expenditures by up to 50 percent for select operators;
a wave of auctions is planned over the next few years. Further, regulatory standards will affect
which players and technologies will dominate the market, and whether new business models
will be viable.

     2. The value at stake
       Latency is measured in fractions of a second. Reliability implies the absence of disruption,
       delay, and frustration. Capacity is the ability to add more traffic without taking away from
       network performance. These metrics can seem abstract to the average person using the
       internet today. Yet improvements in these connectivity standards represent a building block
       that could enable trillions of dollars of value to be generated across the global economy.

       Today consumers power the internet, with online video accounting for the vast majority
       of data traffic. 42 They will likely continue to drive demand growth, particularly as improved
       connectivity makes it possible to deliver instant downloads of ultra-high-definition movies in
       seconds, along with more sophisticated, immersive gaming and virtual reality experiences.

       In a world where productivity growth has stalled, enhanced connectivity could open up new
       avenues for innovating and capturing efficiencies in every domain. Ultra-reliable, low-latency
       fiber and 5G networks combined with edge computing will make it possible for businesses to
       do more with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

       We have identified hundreds of use cases across more than 17 commercial domains that can
       run on an enhanced digital backbone. However, in this research we examine four domains in
       detail (mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail). Implementation of the most promising
       use cases we identified in these domains could increase global GDP by $1.2 trillion to
       $2 trillion by 2030. These use cases, discussed in Chapter 3, are meant to be illustrative
       rather than exhaustive, and others will likely emerge over time. Furthermore, the existence of
       this much value in four domains that account for roughly one-third of global GDP implies that
       there are opportunities worth trillions of dollars across the broader economy.

       Some 70 to 80 percent of this value in the four domains can be achieved through the
       expansion and evolution of existing advanced connectivity technologies and networks.
       Frontier connectivity, which will deliver better network performance and efficiency even as
       data consumption continues to skyrocket, could take many existing use cases to the next
       level—and pave the way for entirely new ones that we cannot foresee today.

       Who exactly will capture the potential value remains an open question. In some cases, it will
       be industry incumbents. But other use cases could give rise to new players, new alliances, and
       companies moving across traditional domain boundaries. That uncertainty is causing some
       hesitation, as we will discuss in later chapters.


       Consumer use and demand for improved connectivity is driven mostly by
       video consumption
       In the not-so-distant past, the average internet user might have logged on only sporadically to
       check e-mails. Today, hundreds of millions of people live a huge portion of their lives online as
       they text, navigate, shop, stream music, and research whatever question pops into their head.

       Around the world, digital usage shows similar patterns across country categories, but those
       patterns are highly skewed. Some 85 percent of the world’s data traffic moves through
       fixed networks (including Wi-Fi), although developing countries rely more heavily on cellular

                                       networks. 43 Consumers generally drive a much larger share of data demand than businesses
                                       globally and in all major regions, constituting more than 80 percent of total internet traffic
                                       on average.

                                       Above all, the internet is feeding an insatiable appetite for video content (Exhibit 3). From
                                       Hollywood blockbusters and streamed TV series to all manner of uploaded oddities on
                                       YouTube, video consumption accounts for some 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic,
                                       with only small differences across regions and country categories. 44 While platforms, content
                                       creators, and advertising firms have benefited, connectivity providers have not been able to
                                       monetize this trend, which creates an investment challenge. 45

                                      Usage is also skewed at the level of individual users. A relatively small group of “power
                                      users” accounts for an outsized share of traffic on both cellular and fixed networks. In many
                                      advanced economies, the top 20 percent of users accounted for more than 60 percent of
                                      cellular data traffic in 2018. There has been widespread adoption of unlimited data plans in
                                      these markets, but nevertheless, a small group drives an unusual share of demand (Exhibit 4).
                                      In terms of fixed service, we see a similar spike at the global level: less than 5 percent
                                      of households generate more than 40 percent of global data traffic, while two-thirds of
                                      households do not use fixed internet at all. 46

                                       In addition to many individual commercial use cases, three key sources
                                       could drive demand for connectivity over the next decade
                                       Three key developments may affect how the demand for connectivity and the buildout of new
                                       networks could reach equilibrium: continued growth in online video consumption, massive
                                       growth in machine-to-machine connections, and significant adoption of augmented and
                                       virtual reality.

                                       The first development would be a continuation of existing trends, with internet traffic from
                                       online video growing 22 times larger over the next decade. The majority of this stems from the
                                       transition from today’s relatively low-resolution content (SD/HD) to higher-definition content.
                                       But we also expect to see significant growth in the number of online viewers and more time
                                       spent viewing per user (Exhibit 5). New networks will have to accommodate rising demand
                                       for speed and capacity. Much of it will come from the same top 20 percent of power users
                                       who consume the majority of video content today; they are likely to be the early adopters of
                                       new connectivity technologies such as high-band 5G. New networks would be cheaper to
                                       operate due to higher spectrum efficiency—and crucially, they can accommodate a variety of
                                       services on the same infrastructure. This type of “network slicing” offers a chance to better
                                       differentiate service levels. 47 Providers could offer basic packages and entry-level pricing to
                                       regular users, who are more price-sensitive, while better monetizing the heavier consumption
                                       of power users.


Exhibit 5

Growth in the number of users and their viewing time, as well as higher-definition content,
will drive massive online video traffic.

1. Most of this growth is likely to occur in India (+150%), trailing countries (+70%), and China (+45%).
2. Most of this growth stems from India and trailing countries catching up in viewing patterns as well as the ongoing shift from regular TV to online
   video consumption in advanced economies.
3. While low-resolution content now accounts for 95% of traffic (SD/HD), 90% of content is expected be high-resolution (UHD or 4K) by 2030.

                                       The second factor influencing the demand for connectivity and provider response is the
                                       massive increase expected in the number of machine-to-machine (M2M) connections. 48 As
                                       the Internet of Things continues to expand, it will create more smart environments in both
                                       industrial and day-to-day settings (including smart homes and smart cities), adding demand
                                       for connectivity beyond consumer entertainment and internet applications. This would
                                       require broad network coverage (likely 5G) that can reliably support very high device density
                                       with lower power consumption that can extend the life of sensors and devices. The price of
                                       sensors and hardware would also need to continue declining. 49 While M2M devices would
                                       constitute a huge majority of the world’s connections, data-hungry consumer devices would
                                       likely continue as the biggest drivers of internet traffic (Exhibit 6). 50 A great deal of M2M data
                                       traffic will likely occur on private networks. 51

A third factor, less certain than the two trends described above, is the possibility that
augmented and virtual reality applications could take off with consumers. Since they
would have to be enticed to upgrade their devices and service levels, this scenario is more
hypothetical. It depends on whether a critical mass of people find augmented and virtual
reality entertainment compelling. Headsets and hardware would also need to improve from
today’s quality and drop in price. These technologies require connectivity with high capacity,
reliability, and extremely low latency. 52 Delivering it would require providers to make heavier
investments in enhanced broadband, 5G, and edge computing.

the world’s new digital backbone, companies will be able to do more—and do it on a bigger
scale, improving their own performance and creating broader economic impact. Based on
extensive research and expert interviews, we have identified hundreds of domain use cases
running on both advanced and frontier networks, independent of the many consumer-driven
entertainment and internet applications that are possible. To illustrate the sheer diversity
of possible use cases, as well as some of the opportunities and implementation challenges,
we profile four commercial domains with large potential to capture higher revenues or
cost efficiencies. 54

Broadly speaking, the use cases identified in these four domains fall into one of two
categories. Approximately 55 to 65 percent of them deliver productivity and efficiency
improvements, while some 35 to 45 percent are focused on topline growth and innovation.
Within these categories, use cases are further segmented based on the way in which they
create value. In the case of productivity and efficiency, they may improve labor, asset, or
resource productivity. Those focused on topline growth and innovation may expand existing
revenue streams or create new ones (Exhibit 7). Chapter 3 takes an in-depth look at how
companies in mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail could take advantage of some of
the use cases that are enabled by advanced connectivity.

The specific use cases that we sized across these four commercial domains alone could boost
global GDP by an estimated $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030. This is equivalent to 3.5 to
5.5 percent of their expected GDP. However, others could exist today or emerge in the future
in these domains, which would increase the economic impact.

The types of use cases we sized in these four areas are relevant in other domains as well.55
Next-generation inventory management, for example, has applicability beyond retail; it also
has value for logistics and consumer goods companies. Improving equipment utilization
applies not only in factories but also in mining, oil and gas, and commercial real estate
operations. Over and above the value generated in mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and
retail (which collectively account for a third of global GDP), use cases running on advanced
and frontier connectivity could generate trillions of dollars in value across the entire
global economy.

     We use the term “domain use cases,” recognizing that some will involve industries and ecosystems that cross traditional
     industry lines. This term also applies to applications driven by industries that are ultimately consumer facing, such as
     retail and healthcare.
54
     In addition to illustrating the range of use cases, these domains were chosen as a large, representative cross-section of
     the economy. They include both industrial and consumer-facing businesses, with a diverse mix of assets, occupations
     and geographic footprints, and they span many different supply chains.
55
     On 5G specifically, several papers make the point that the economic potential is linked to business use cases and cross-
     industry relevance. See for instance “The road to 5G networks: Experience to date and future developments,” OECD
     Digital Economy Papers, No. 284, July 2019; also “The 5G economy: How 5G technology will contribute to the global
     economy,” IHS Economics and IHS Technology, January 2017.

There are additional economic benefits to businesses, consumers and society that are not
captured in this analysis. They include, for instance, the ability for businesses to differentiate
themselves by creating a rich customer experience; the benefit of having better health
outcomes and healthier, more productive citizens; and the ability to reduce waste and better
manage capital and natural resources in production processes.

In the four domains we studied, advanced connectivity can enable some 70 to 80 percent
of the economic potential. A great deal of room can be achieved without investing in frontier
connectivity. This is because even in the wealthiest economies, only a relatively limited set

of leading companies are deploying the most ambitious use cases that can run on today’s
networks. As connectivity, technology tools, and services become more affordable and
mainstream, there is much more room for adoption to spread across domains, driving bigger
productivity gains. Declining prices for RFID and NFC tags, for example, could mean they
can be used on many more consumer goods, which may magnify the benefits of automated
inventory management systems for retailers.

By contrast, use cases that require frontier connectivity such as high-band 5G could
eventually generate some 30 percent of the potential impact. High-band 5G will create
greater network efficiency, boosting speeds even as providers accommodate more consumer
demand and more devices. Existing use cases can run on a bigger scale while becoming more
sophisticated and reliable. Tens of thousands of infrastructure sensors in a dense urban area
could capture real-time data, sending alerts to vehicles and public agencies securely in real
time to manage traffic and speed emergency response. Frontier connectivity can also analyze
enormous quantities of video from networks of camera installations. However, while this has
important applications in law enforcement and security, it also raises concerns about privacy
and misuse that need to be addressed with safeguards.

For many users, a key selling point of high-band 5G is lower latency. Manufacturers, in
particular, are gravitating toward these networks to implement system-wide real-time
process control across multiple lines and plants. Ultra-low latency is also important
for augmented reality entertainment as well as AR tools for quality inspections and
worker training.

It is possible that the value of use cases running on frontier connectivity could exceed
our estimates, depending on whether some high-potential but still speculative use cases
like augmented reality and self-driving vehicles fully come to fruition. A stronger digital
backbone can also support new use cases we cannot predict today. The extent to which these
developments—and the related demand—actually materialize will likely have a meaningful
impact on the deployment and adoption of frontier connectivity.


Beyond the business value is an opportunity to bring more people online,
enabling up to $2 trillion in GDP impact
Despite broad global adoption of mobile connectivity, nearly 40 percent of the world’s
population remains offline altogether or under-connected (that is, they are not yet using
3G-capable data networks or better). There is great human and economic potential in
bringing them online, including improved communication, social inclusion, and enhanced
productivity across domains. 56 Connectivity can, for example, create a platform for bringing
mobile finance to previously unbanked populations and expanding access to credit in
developing countries. 57 The internet could be a great equalizer. In fact, providing “universal

     and affordable access to the internet in the least developed countries” is one of the UN’s
     Sustainable Development Goals.

     By decade’s end, the share of the world’s population remaining under- or unconnected
     could decrease by half. This is due to a mix of organic factors driving adoption (such as rising
     incomes and literacy rates) plus the expansion of network coverage and the overall increasing
     affordability of devices and services. This newly online population will likely gain intermediate
     connectivity via 3G or 4G/LTE cellular networks. 58

     In real terms, this means that they will be able to enjoy basic web browsing, consumer mobile
     phone applications, e-commerce, and the consumption of online video. This stands in
     contrast with users of advanced and frontier mobile connectivity, who will be able to stream
     ultra-high-definition video, participate in ultra-low-latency high-definition cloud gaming,
     enjoy immersive virtual and augmented reality applications, and have first access to other
     consumer applications that have yet to be defined. But new users in the developing world will
     gain access to critically important capabilities and services, from news and information to
     mobile financial services.

     Bringing more of the world online could add some $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion to global GDP
     by 2030. Beyond the clear social and economic benefits, this growth in mobile subscribers
     would be a significant boon to connectivity providers—at a time when they sorely need new
     sources of revenue. See Chapter 5 for more on this topic.




     58
          We use the term “intermediate connectivity” to refer to access to 3G and 4G/LTE cellular networks (with speeds of 1 to
          50 Mbps and latency of ~50 milliseconds or more). Compared to advanced and frontier connectivity that we defined
          previously, intermediate connectivity features different technical capabilities, supported applications, and subscriber
          populations.

3. Connectivity at
   work: Use cases in
   select domains
  Both advanced and frontier connectivity will provide companies of all kinds with a platform for
  applications that can boost efficiency and innovation. The range of new use cases that can
  run on top of a stronger digital backbone is remarkably broad—and it may eventually include
  some that we cannot imagine today.

  As noted in Chapter 2, we have identified hundreds of potential use cases across 17 domains
  of the global economy ranging from agriculture and industrials to healthcare and education.

  To illustrate the diversity of what is possible and the economic opportunity, we highlight four
  of these domains with significant potential to capture higher revenues or cost efficiencies.
  This chapter takes a deeper look at select use cases that could materialize in mobility,
  healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. In these domains alone, some $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion
  of GDP value is at stake—along with the possibility of enhancing health and safety as well
  as making industrial operations more sustainable. The use cases described in the chapter
  are meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, and others will likely emerge. We also
  consider scenarios for how the domains themselves could evolve as use cases are adopted.
  Finally, we consider some of the challenges that need to be addressed to scale up adoption in
  each domain.


  Connectivity underpins major changes unfolding in mobility and
  automotive
  Cars are already getting smarter. Their systems provide enhanced safety; navigation;
  maintenance alerts; and voice control of music, phone calls, and messaging.

  Incremental feature upgrades in traditional vehicles are only part of the story. In cities
  worldwide, e-hailing and other digitally powered shared transportation services have
  transformed the way people get from point A to point B. Rides can be hailed by tapping an
  app. Electric vehicles are making inroads, and they could take off sharply as battery prices
  continue to fall and recharging infrastructure is built out. The concept of “mobility” itself
  reflects the broadening of options for getting around and the formation of an ecosystem.
  In addition to automakers, this ecosystem includes car-sharing services, public transit,
  infrastructure, hardware and software, and more—in short, all of the actors and enablers
  involving in moving people (and goods) from point-to-point on the ground.

  The decade ahead promises even bigger shifts. Optimizing the utilization of vehicles and
  infrastructure and expanding shared mobility solutions will be paramount in crowded cities.
  The market for vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems should continue to grow by
  15 percent a year in Europe and almost 30 percent a year in China.59 Below we focus on the
  use cases and dynamics emerging exclusively from advanced and frontier connectivity.

       This refers to vehicles with up to Level 3 autonomy, as defined by SAE International. See “SAE International releases
       updated visual chart for its ‘Levels of Driving Automation’ standard for self-driving vehicles,” SAE International,
       December 2018.




  Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                                                       33


     Use cases and the value at stake
     Technologies such as low- to mid-band 5G, sensors, and short-range communication
     systems enable cars to interact seamlessly and continuously with the world around them.
     This new type of “vehicle-to-everything” communication has four dimensions, with each one
     supporting multiple use cases and new sources of value.

     Vehicle-to-network communication: V2N provides high bandwidth, low latency, and
     increasingly broad coverage. This will allow cars to add new capabilities such as real-time
     monitoring of the driver’s health condition and instant over-the-air software updates. In
     addition to streaming video for passengers, advanced connectivity could even deliver a full
     haptic/4D video or gaming experience that integrates the twists and turns of the road.60 We
     estimate that multiple types of personalized “infotainment” could create some $15 billion to
     $20 billion in revenue opportunities in subscription services alone. In addition, networks that
     support video conferencing could turn cars into “rolling offices,” allowing passengers to be
     more productive. Advanced connectivity also makes it possible to take a more predictive and
     proactive approach to vehicle maintenance. Manufacturers can monitor the condition of each
     system in the car through signals sent by IoT sensors and notify the owner to schedule repairs
     before a breakdown occurs, improving the vehicle’s durability and lifespan. Service offerings
     could even include unsupervised towing, repairs, and returns so that no time and energy
     is required of owners. Predictive maintenance represents a potential new revenue pool of
     $45 billion to $70 billion annually.

     Vehicle-to-vehicle communication: V2V technology relies on short-range connectivity.
     It involves cars “talking” to each other and driving cooperatively—a breakthrough that can
     improve the flow of traffic, avoid collisions, and pave the way for autonomous and semi-
     autonomous driving (see Box 3, “Connectivity and autonomous vehicles”). Vehicles can drive
     together more closely with shorter distances between them at highway speeds. In addition
     to lessening congestion and improving fuel economy, this would increase the capacity of
     existing roads, lessening the need for costly new builds. Vehicles that encounter hazards
     such as potholes, ice patches, or debris can give others advance warning. We estimate that
     warning systems can lower the cost of vehicle repairs by $20 billion to $30 billion annually—
     not to mention the lives that can be saved and the injuries that can be prevented.

     Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication: V2I, running on low- to mid-band 5G as well
     as short-range connectivity, enables two-way signals between vehicles and roads, traffic
     lights, bridges, toll collection points, and other infrastructure. This could help drivers and
     passengers optimize their routes, cutting down on time lost in traffic. It would also give public
     agencies more sophisticated tools for real-time traffic management and valuable data on
     road usage, public safety, and maintenance needs for future planning. Overall, we estimate
     that some $10 billion to $15 billion in cost savings and revenue opportunities could be realized
     from improved navigation systems and navigation subscription services. On top of this comes
     the countless hours saved and reduced city smog from better traffic planning.

     Vehicle-to-pedestrian communication: Utilizing low- to mid-band 5G and LPWA networks,
     V2P connects vehicles with smartphones and other devices held by people on the street
     (and with the broader environment, such as gas stations). This should improve safety by
     ensuring that cars react to avoid hitting pedestrians. Along with the safety element, V2P can
     give pedestrians an integrated view of the fastest and most comfortable way to reach their
     destination. We estimate that additional services such as offering parked cars to pedestrians
     as pick-up spots for packages, carpooling, or subscription services for automatic refueling
     could potentially be worth some $5 billion to $10 billion annually.

        Box 3.
        Connectivity and autonomous vehicles

        By definition, the truly autonomous vehicles of the future will not rely on a permanent
        network connection to navigate busy city streets without human intervention. However,
        enhanced connectivity such as 5G can accelerate the development and commercial
        roll-out of autonomous vehicles.

        In current connected cars and pilot autonomous vehicles, a significant amount of
        data processing from sensors and lidar systems is done within the vehicle itself, using
        costly supercomputer hardware. In the future, however, new roads and infrastructure
        with reliable ultra-high-speed, low-latency connectivity (such as high-band 5G) could
        possibly transfer these tasks to the edge or the cloud, decreasing hardware costs.
        Furthermore, various V2X communications could be supplemented with high-band 5G
        connectivity with low latency for rapid and secure data transfer. Lastly, these frontier
        connections will enable live software updates and data refreshes (such as live layer
        maps) through over-the-air updates.

        In sum, although we do not consider “autonomous driving” as a separate use case in our
        sizing, these capabilities will create meaningful value to enterprises, consumers, and
        society by progressively steering toward a future of full autonomy.




     The use cases described above are only a few examples of how connectivity on roadways and
     in vehicles could open up new revenue streams and create cost savings. All told, we find that
     improved connectivity could enable more than 80 other innovations in mobility.

     Looking at the penetration rates of connected vehicles in different regions, we find significant
     variances in adoption, due to infrastructure differences, regulation, and other factors
     (Exhibit 8). We then extrapolated the individual car unit prices and adoption rates of use cases
     to the overall pool of vehicles in operation.

     In total, we estimate that mobility use cases could generate $170 billion to $280 billion of GDP
     impact by 2030.

                                      Implications for the mobility ecosystem

                                      The traditional automotive value chain has evolved considerably in recent years, and it will
                                      continue to morph as mobility moves toward a more connected future of electric, shared,
                                      and autonomous vehicles (Exhibit 9). The race to be in the forefront of this fast-changing
                                      market has already given rise to dozens of strategic partnerships between automakers,
                                      tech companies, and new players along the value chain. The roles played by providers of
                                      network infrastructure, operating systems, and cloud platforms as well as app developers and
                                      distributors will continue to expand.

                                      However, it is not fully clear how the mobility ecosystem will look in a decade’s time. Three
                                      scenarios could unfold (Exhibit 10). One possibility is that automakers and their suppliers
                                      form platform alliances to share R&D and deployment costs and retain ownership of a
                                      common operating system and data platform. This would benefit traditional manufacturers,
                                      connectivity providers, and the app and service providers that manage to partner in
                                      development. However, automakers would need the relevant expertise and capabilities to
                                      compete with established tech firms.

                                      Another plausible scenario would see a major tech player or a group of tech players
                                      dominating the market for operating systems and cloud services for vehicles. This would allow
                                      automakers to keep their focus on vehicle development, licensing customized versions of the
                                      standard operating system to suit each model. This scenario could occur if a major tech player
                                      manages to build on its established consumer base in other domains to reach a critical mass
                                      of adopters quickly. Still another possible path would see multiple tech players competing with
                                      their own functional platforms, with a smaller ecosystem revolving around each one.

                                      Both traditional automotive and parts manufacturers and tech players should regard mobility
                                      as a broad and complex ecosystem that no single player can fully control. Mobile phones,
                                      for example, moved away from individual companies developing propriety hardware and
                                      operating systems to open operating systems that can be adapted to local needs, inviting
                                      third-party app development and monetization. Automakers can consider a similar approach
                                      by opening up their platforms and hardware, looking to app developers and other partners
                                      with complementary capabilities to provide services.

     Connectivity providers will want to avoid being regarded as providers of a commoditized
     service in this ecosystem and become credible partners, perhaps in the development of
     specific features and services. Each player’s position will be affected by which operating
     systems and features attract a critical mass of users, their own ability to integrate with other
     platforms, and whether they have deep capabilities to compete in multiple areas. There is a
     unique opportunity for the companies that recognize the possibility of actively taking part in
     shaping the dynamics of their local mobility ecosystem.

     Some issues to be addressed

     Automakers, suppliers, technology and infrastructure players, service providers, and dealers
     alike have yet to capture the full value of connectivity, whether in revenue, safety, and
     operational efficiencies. A few specific challenges stand out.

     Scaling up connectivity services requires skills and resources that stretch beyond any single
     player. To span this gap, collaboration will be key. In a recent McKinsey survey, executives
     overwhelmingly identified automakers as harder to partner with than start-ups or tech
     players.61 Nonetheless, monetizing car data will require real digital ecosystems along the
     value chain.

     Today the current “connected service” strategy is not always rooted in a clear vision of
     what the end customer wants or needs; it has been changing incrementally on the basis of
     hardware and software advances.

     In addition to understanding how these features might make their lives easier, customers
     must trust that the data they share will be held and used responsibly. For most of these
     applications, data gathering could be affected by new individual consent requirements
     introduced by regulations like Europe’s GDPR.62 Automakers are approaching this differently.
     Some are adopting an opt-in approach that obtains an individual’s express consent before
     collecting personal information. The opt-out approach used by other automakers requires
     consumers to proactively decline personal data tracking and storage. Customers will only
     opt in if they are convinced that the exchange—whether via advertising or a direct fee—is
     worthwhile relative to the feature’s value.

     Development of new connected services will require companies to take a different
     organizational approach. They will need to shift away from rigid, siloed operations, although
     the McKinsey executive survey revealed that most companies do not have a clear view of what
     the ideal structure could be.

     Lastly, more enhanced connectivity service experiences will require continuous coverage of
     high-bandwidth, low-latency network like 5G over relatively large areas. Currently, there is
     limited visibility on actual future investment to support this outside of urban pockets. Similarly,
     while V2X pilots are underway, meaningful adoption of these use cases would need broad
     adoption across the entire car parc (all cars on the road), not just new sales. Even if all new
     cars are fully connected, it will take years for the entire car parc to turn over.

Connectivity could unlock elusive productivity gains in healthcare,
bending the cost curve and improving the quality of care
Patient histories have gone from paper to electronic medical records. Data is increasingly
being aggregated to develop new treatments and identify the most effective protocols.
Solutions such as telemedicine are making consultations more convenient in advanced
economies—and bringing much-needed medical care to regions with limited access.63

Despite this, technology has not delivered the kind of progress that many expected.
Compared to other domains, healthcare has lagged in digitizing.64 Furthermore, the value
created by technology-enabled services is hard to isolate. Many of the benefits diffuse across
health systems. In some cases, they have led to growing demand, not all of which is related to
need. Along with patients requiring treatment, the “worried well” are also finding it easier to
access care.

Powerful tools such as advanced analytics, AI-powered diagnostics and population health
analytics, connected medical devices, and wearables all depend on enhanced connectivity.
However, realizing the full potential these technologies can deliver will require far more
substantial changes in how health systems operate, enablers and incentives, and the players
within the ecosystem.

Use cases and the value at stake
Under the right circumstances, improved connectivity could help to reduce costs by delivering
productivity improvements and better outcomes and free up investment capacity that will
most likely go elsewhere in the domain. We estimate that enhanced connectivity could enable
efficiency gains that would translate into $250 billion to $420 billion of GDP impact by 2030.
We estimate that advanced connectivity can deliver about 80 percent of the value at stake,
while frontier connectivity accounts for the remainder.

Realizing the benefits of enhanced connectivity is one part of a multi-step journey. The overall
benefits of digitizing healthcare (beyond connectivity-related benefits) are massive and could
unlock some $1.5 trillion to $3.0 trillion annually by 2030.65 This would represent efficiencies
of 11 to 20 percent of the nearly $15 trillion in global healthcare spending MGI projects for that
year. Beyond these direct economic benefits, a further digitized healthcare system could also
have significant indirect effects on the economy resulting from better health outcomes and
healthier populations. We estimate that this effect could further boost global GDP by some
$2.1 trillion annually.

A few use cases serve to highlight the potential impact of connectivity in healthcare:

Remote patient monitoring: Wherever they are, patients with wearable sensor devices on
or underneath the skin can have frequent checks of vital readings such as heart rate, blood
pressure, glucose level, and oxygen saturation. The resulting data can be instantly transmitted
on an advanced mobile connection for evaluation. These systems can signal both patients
and care providers in real time if preventive measures are needed. This can avoid or shorten
hospital stays and lower readmission rates. Remote monitoring can help patients keep
chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, heart failure, and
hypertension under control while freeing them from constant medical appointments. Since
these conditions and their complications drive an outsized share of healthcare spending,
there are economic benefits as well.

We estimate that remote patient monitoring systems running on advanced networks
could deliver some $70 billion to $120 billion in annual value worldwide, along with lower
morbidity and greater patient satisfaction, convenience, and independence. Frontier
connectivity can give these systems more sophisticated capabilities. Accurate and
continuous data transmission can identify warning signs sooner and resolve them faster, with
minimal interventions.

AI-enabled decision support solutions: These tools put the latest information in the hands
of healthcare professionals, including constantly updated, evidence-based protocols;
electronic health records; and data from patient monitoring systems. Birmingham, England,
has tested out a system to connect doctors with paramedics in an ambulance. In the pilot
demonstration, the doctor used a virtual reality headset and a joystick to direct the paramedic
to take an ultrasound scan of a patient with a haptic glove and transmit the images back to the
doctor in real time.66

Decision support systems can now integrate AI, which can “learn” from very large datasets
(such as patient histories, test results, and demographics as well as genetic profiles).
Solutions available as “software as a service” (SaaS) can give any care setting anywhere
in the world decision support if the right infrastructure is in place. The combination of
enhanced connectivity with high-bandwidth, low-latency networks plus expected advances
in computing, storage, and sensors could enable healthcare providers to run these systems.
They could create $40 billion to $70 billion in efficiencies by accelerating diagnoses,
preventing errors and complications, identifying the most effective treatment protocols, and
offering more personalized treatment plans.

Integrated command centers: RFID and sensor tags installed across a hospital and
bar-codes from patient bracelets and clinician tags can capture real-time data. When
combined with short-range connectivity, multi-department healthcare organizations can
gain a comprehensive view of operations. A central dashboard can manage patient flows,
ensuring that each person is in the most appropriate care setting, keeping beds available, and
optimizing staff scheduling.

Advanced connectivity is the underlying infrastructure that can link multiple healthcare IT
systems as well as sensors and tags within a continuum of care. It can enable faster, more
accurate, and more seamless information transfers. Integrated command centers running
on advanced connectivity could produce efficiencies that add up to some $40 billion to
$70 billion annually.

Implications for the future of healthcare
Healthcare could look very different in a decade’s time from three vantage points due in large
part to enhanced connectivity:

— For individuals, enhanced connectivity will foster the wider use of remote patient
  monitoring, which can help people manage long-term conditions (Exhibit 11). Wearables,
  which can empower people to take preventive steps, rely on sensors and 5G or Wi-Fi
  coverage. Telemedicine can provide access to consultations on the go, at any hour, with
  much broader geographical coverage. Healthcare could become more convenient, more
  streamlined, and easier to navigate. Advanced technologies will improve patient outcomes
  by giving them faster access to care, more accurate diagnoses, ongoing monitoring, and
  rapidly adjusted treatments. As researchers study vast genomic datasets, the concept of
  personalized care tailored to an individual’s genetic makeup could become a reality.

                                      — Health systems should be able to use enhanced connectivity to achieve more efficient
                                        information sharing and optimize the use of limited resources. Staff can be deployed
                                        more efficiently (by, for example, relying on telemedicine instead of staffing sub-scale
                                        units in more remote locations). At the same time, providers and institutions will be able
                                        to improve patient outcomes by expanding access to expertise and coordinating care
                                        more effectively. Many large hospitals and health systems are already implementing more
                                        sophisticated digital management systems. In Southern California, the UCLA Health
                                        system is monitoring patients remotely.67 The Torrance Memorial Medical Center uses a
                                        command center to improve patient flow and ensure that beds are ready when needed;
                                        it relies on sensors, short-range connectivity, and fiber to support the infrastructure.68
                                        Oxford University Hospitals relies on AI tools for image interpretation and decision
                                        support.69 Israel’s largest healthcare organization is using IoT-based “smart cabinets” to
                                        manage its inventory of medical devices and supplies.70 Toronto’s Humber River Hospital
                                        has prioritized automating as many manual tasks as possible, optimizing patient flow and
                                        freeing up staff to spend more time directly with patients.71

                                      Wider economies stand to benefit from connectivity-driven changes in healthcare. In addition
                                      to creating opportunities in adjacent domains, a more connected and data-driven approach to
                                      care will make for healthier and more productive populations—with all of the economic, social,
                                      and human benefits that this implies.

Issues to be addressed
Driving adoption and changing established ways of working is not easy. The right enablers
need to be put in place. Then it will take investment to accelerate the pace of change. To
inject a dose of innovation on a large scale, new business models and approaches will need to
be encouraged.

Some of the barriers that exist in healthcare systems today need to be overcome. These
include the absence of clear reimbursement paths for digital offerings, the lack of frameworks
(within and across countries) about how to invest in and fund technology-driven healthcare
services, and the testing of connectivity-enabled use cases to confirm they improve patient
outcomes as well as productivity. Healthcare providers themselves have limited digital
capabilities, which makes them reluctant to adopt new digital offerings for both patients and
healthcare professionals.

Common data standards are critical across extremely complex environments, in which
multiple organizations can play a role in treating a single patient. Without them, technology
modernization has been a difficult task, marked by overspending and limited quantifiable
impact. Privacy and data security are paramount in healthcare; cybersecurity concerns are
real and widespread. Regulatory frameworks have been slow-moving, but clear guidelines are
needed to protect patients and clarify how data should be handled and how it can be shared
and monetized.

It will take more than improved connectivity to realize all of this potential—and to change
established, fragmented systems quickly. Innovation funding needs to become a priority
for governments. Healthcare systems will need to add digital skills and roles, from system
architects to data scientists and user experience designers. Countries with underdeveloped
healthcare systems will need to take a thoughtful, collaborative approach to designing
greenfield digital architecture—hopefully avoiding some of the legacy issues and mistakes
bogging down some wealthier countries.

Domain players will need to collaborate and move beyond their traditional boundaries and
silos. For instance, connecting healthcare systems could open up new business models for
incumbents and make room for new players. Payors (or providers taking on the role of payors)
can be the drivers of change, drawing on patient data, establishing new incentive structures,
and potentially taking more of the risk (and reward) associated with technology investment.
Employers, too, may take on a greater degree of risk and reward themselves in some markets,
perhaps collaborating with providers to serve their employees and capture more value from
virtual and preventive care. Technology and connectivity providers will play a bigger role in
healthcare and have an opportunity to carve out some niche markets. But all stakeholders
need to solve the issue of interoperability across systems and solutions—and there may be
only be a few winners here, as scale matters.


Frontier connectivity is a platform for implementing Industry 4.0
technologies in manufacturing and other advanced industries
A wave of technology advances collectively known as “Industry 4.0” has been driven by an
explosion in the volume of available data, developments in analytics and machine learning,
new forms of human-machine interaction (such as touch interfaces and augmented-reality
systems), and the ability to transmit digital instructions to the physical world.72

These complementary technologies can run smart, cost-efficient, and automated factories.
But where connectivity has been a barrier, a variety of new standards (such as WLAN
7, BT mesh, fiber, and high-band 5G) could accelerate the shift to a more digital form
of manufacturing.

Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                                                 45


     Today most factories and plants have fixed and industrial Wi-Fi networks that are
     relatively inexpensive but have several drawbacks. Wi-Fi often encounters interference,
     particularly in dense settings, and fixed connections are complex to manage and costly
     in large manufacturing environments. With the introduction of high-band 5G networks,
     manufacturers will gain a reliable alternative that enables critical communications, such as the
     wireless control of machines and manufacturing robots. In fact, high-band 5G may become
     the technology of choice for both industrial mobile applications and manufacturing settings
     where a fixed connection is unsuitable, such as those dispersed over a large area or including
     wide movement of assets.

     One option for industrial companies to achieve frontier connectivity is building private 5G
     networks. Because data is processed without touching public networks, companies that build
     private networks can protect sensitive production-related data and enjoy the flexibility and
     reliability to develop proprietary applications. Automakers already use private 5G networks
     to link data across production systems and track products on assembly lines. Regulators in
     several countries are facilitating the creation of private 5G networks for industrial companies
     by allocating spectrum for their use. When spectrum allocation begins, large manufacturers
     will probably set up private 5G networks right away. But it may take another three to four years
     for mid-sized companies to follow suit.

     Use cases and the value at stake
     The business value resulting from use cases running on improved connectivity could
     generate from $400 billion to $650 billion of GDP impact by 2030. Most of the applications in
     manufacturing and other advanced industries requires the kind of speed, latency, and device
     density that frontier high-band 5G can support.

     Some of the most compelling manufacturing use cases that can run on public or private high-
     band 5G networks include:

     Automated guided vehicles (AGVs): Factories now rely mostly on transport vehicles that
     either operate in fixed paths or have only basic capabilities for optimizing routes. These
     vehicles are equipped with sensors to assist with navigation and help prevent collisions.
     Frontier connectivity paves the way for the deployment of large fleets of next-generation
     AGVs, which will connect with cloud or edge servers that can support advanced analytics.
     These vehicles can review data to make sophisticated navigation and coordination decisions
     based on the real-time context of other connected machinery and AGVs. Frontier connectivity
     offers the low latency needed for safety stops and real-time navigation. We estimate that
     the combination of enhanced connectivity and automated guided vehicles could generate
     $130 billion to $200 billion in business impact by improving productivity in logistics.

     3-D bin picking: In most factories, machines pick parts from bins by taking items from a fixed
     location. With advanced or frontier connectivity, robots will be able to use sophisticated vision
     systems to locate parts regardless of their location. Pickit, for example, has created robots
     equipped with HD cameras that can locate parts with computer vision. Since advanced and
     frontier connectivity enable data analysis in the cloud or at the edge, the robot itself requires
     minimal processing power. We estimate that 3-D bin picking can generate $30 billion to
     $50 billion through improved productivity.

     System-wide real-time process control: Companies can capture significant value by using
     advanced analytics to optimize and adjust processes—not only on select assembly lines but
     across multiple plants. In many cases, companies can retrofit old equipment and reliably
     connect existing machinery and sensors to perform sensor-driven analyses. This is particularly
     important in process industries, where companies typically retain the same equipment for
     many years, with complex and costly fixed networks that extend across large sites. To enable
     real-time control, they need the kind of wireless, reliable, and low-latency communication that
     frontier connectivity can provide. Real-time process control can significantly reduce defects,
     rework, and breakdowns, creating some $130 billion to $200 billion in value.

     Augmented reality: Workers can use AR glasses that display instructions in their visual
     field to guide tasks such as quality inspections. These glasses must process data in real
     time to provide a seamless and responsive experience. The low latency and high-speed
     communication of high-band 5G will also allow data processing to occur on the edge, which
     decreases costs and increases energy efficiency. Augmented reality in production, logistics,
     and R&D can generate some $45 billion to $75 billion in value.

     Vision quality checks: AI can significantly improve visual inspections. Frontier connectivity
     can boost the performance of real-time analytics within vision quality systems so that
     deviations are spotted quickly, before multiple units are processed. While development of
     traditional machine vision models is complex and requires about eight months, AI algorithms
     can be trained and deployed within weeks. We estimate that vision quality checks can
     generate $50 billion to $100 billion through improved productivity.

     Strategic implications for industrial companies

     While we do not expect a disruption in the industrial manufacturing value chain, established
     players have an opportunity to capture significant value. We expect the number of 5G-specific
     IoT devices to take off in a few years’ time, with strong deployment in manufacturing and
     processing (Exhibit 12). Industrial firms need to develop a strategy now for getting started.

     Given the breadth and complexity of 5G systems, manufacturers often turn to technology
     providers to define a “just right” solution that delivers the best return on investment. Industrial
     automation providers and telecom operators (or private network specialists) can be key
     partners in laying the right foundation. Application and solution providers contribute to the
     implementation of the actual features.

     Early movers have already started 5G partnerships. Daimler, for example, has partnered
     with Telefónica and Ericsson to implement a private 5G network for automobile production.73
     Audi and Ericsson have teamed up to implement 5G technology in the “Audi Production
     Lab” in Gaimersheim, while Volkswagen partnered with AWS to build an industrial cloud for
     IoT devices.74

     On the supply side, industrial automation players will want to make their own products
     5G ready. A good starting point for the short term would be leveraging the experience of
     customers who are early adopters and apply those lessons to product enhancements. To
     develop a better understanding of market development and customer needs, sales teams
     need to identify emerging frontier connectivity use cases and feed those insights into product
     portfolio development. Given the uncertainty surrounding which applications will be widely
     adopted and when, automation players will need to review their offerings frequently. In the
     longer term, once frontier connectivity becomes broadly available, a comprehensive portfolio
     of 5G-enabled products might be beneficial, with a modular approach that can optimize costs.

     Issues to be addressed
     When technologies are new and unfamiliar, companies may question the business case for
     adopting them. Struggling to clearly evaluate the bottom-line effect against the expected
     cost of implementation is a real hurdle for manufacturing companies considering frontier
     connectivity networks and the array of technologies that would run on them. Manufacturers
     have large, extensive asset bases with major sunk costs, and upgrading equipment and
     processes is not easy. Adoption and change in large manufacturing companies can be
     slowed by the number of decision makers involved and a top-down emphasis on digitization
     and automation.

                                    Implementing a frontier connectivity use case will often require collaboration with new types
                                    of partners beyond the usual supplier ecosystem.75 Advanced warehouse management
                                    using automated guided vehicles, for example, involves infrastructure providers,
                                    technology providers, vehicle and equipment manufacturers, and a dedicated team for final
                                    implementation and ongoing operation. New types of training may be needed.

                                    Data security is paramount for most industrial companies, which argues for building private
                                    networks rather than relying on public networks. But this is a costly strategy and may be
                                    prohibitive for mid-size manufacturers.


                                    Advanced connectivity and the falling price of key technologies sets the
                                    stage for transformation on a larger scale in retail
                                    The way we shop is very different today than it was a decade ago. E-commerce continues to
                                    post double-digit growth each year, reaching some $3.5 trillion in worldwide retail sales in
                                    2019.76 But online shopping is only part of the story. Technology and automation are now at
                                    the heart of how the entire retail value chain is evolving.

     For customers, digital increasingly drives choices even when purchases are made in stores.
     For instance, roughly half of shoppers have used omnichannel services (such as checking
     online to see whether a product is in stock before going to a store).77 Just over half of US
     shoppers log onto Amazon for their initial product research. For retailers, analytics and
     automation are driving efficiency improvements in forecasting, inventory management, back-
     office operations, and marketing.78

     Multiple elements of the retail environment are changing. Customers increasingly take their
     shopping cues from digital influencers and purchase through social media platforms. Almost
     one-third of consumers actively flip through their social media accounts while shopping.79
     Customer expectations are quickly evolving, with millennials and Generation Z finding
     e-commerce more convenient and relevant and prioritizing it over in-store experience.
     This shift toward digital touchpoints and omnichannel business models is set to continue.
     Traditional domain boundaries are blurring as retailers experiment with cross-domain
     partnerships, subscription models, delivery, maintenance, and new kinds of services
     and experiences.

     In this rapidly changing and more digital world, brick-and-mortar players want to provide
     seamless convenience and the kind of personal experience that customers have come to
     expect based on new standards set by e-commerce players. As retailers respond to this
     disruption, they are doing so by integrating technologies across their value chain to reinvent
     the physical store experience. 80

     The most promising use cases involve capturing data and analyzing it in real time—and with
     a high degree of reliability and security. Functions such as computer vision cannot work with
     any lag in connectivity. Instant and secure connections are required to feed information from
     across the entire value chain into backend computing systems.

     Three types of technologies are pivotal. They include multiple types of sensors, passive and
     active RFID trackers, NFC, Bluetooth beacons, and cameras that enable data collection;
     substantial storage capacity to handle reams of data on customers and store operations;
     and enhanced computing power to process this data and run functions powered by artificial
     intelligence (such as computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning,
     recommendation algorithms, and robotics). The price of these technologies has been
     decreasing over the past 10 years, and this trend is expected to continue over the next
     decade. 81 These trends could soon pass a tipping point in terms of penetration throughout the
     retail domain.

     Use cases enabled by advanced connectivity
     Use cases in retail involve a few key technologies: sensors, trackers, computer vision, AI,
     advanced analytics, and smart interfaces. More than 90 percent of them will come to life with
     advanced connectivity like fiber, low- to mid-band 5G, Wi-Fi 6, or short-range communication
     systems such as RFID automated scanners. High-band 5G is not a prerequisite, although it
     could boost efficiency. The business value resulting from these use cases could generate
     $420 billion to $700 billion of GDP impact by 2030.

               Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution   51


     Three primary types of use cases in retail illustrate the value of connectivity:

     End-to-end product visibility: The shift in customer expectations is pushing retailers toward
     an omnichannel operating model. Fulfilment models have evolved over the years to offer
     consumers a plethora of choices. They can buy online and pick up in a store, ship from store to
     home, ship from distribution center to home, ship from store to store, drop-ship, and more. As
     a result, retailers face the challenge of managing inventory accuracy at the product level.

     There are efficiencies and savings waiting to be captured across the supply chain—and
     visibility alone can unlock a great deal of it. Multiple type of levers can be deployed, including
     next-generation warehouse management, real-time transportation visibility, out-of-stock
     mitigation, shrinkage reduction, or on-shelf inventory tracking. Connectivity-enabled end-to-
     end visibility across the value chain could generate cost savings of $100 billion to $160 billion
     and boost revenue by $60 billion to $100 billion.

     Retailers can use different types of technologies to gain the information and insights
     they need. Active RFIDs at the product, pallet, or container level, for instance, enable fully
     automatic scanning of products at scale to optimize warehouse operations. Warehouse
     management tools alone could generate about $5 billion to $10 billion in cost savings.

     Combining trackers with computer vision and weight sensors allows retailers to monitor every
     store shelf with precision, reducing instances of stock-outs and feeding into forecasting.
     However, computer vision requires significant computing power and an ultra-high-speed
     connection. Automated and real-time inventory management could generate up to $60 billion
     to $100 billion in additional revenue by ensuring that stock does not run out.

     Bringing this same combination of trackers and computer vision into stores, retailers could
     identify when products are missing and send automatic push notifications to associates.
     On-shelf inventory tracking could lead to as much as $35 billion to $55 billion in cost savings,
     significantly reducing time associates spend on manual inventory checks.

     As the price of trackers and sensors comes down, suppliers would have incentive to apply
     them to a wider range of products. They, too, can benefit from end-to-end visibility; access
     to more customer data can help them improve their own processes and bargaining positions.
     Companies in the consumer-packaged goods industry may become increasingly willing
     to source-tag more products to capture more data themselves. This could produce a
     virtuous circle.

     Frictionless in-store experience: E-commerce has raised the bar for convenience, and
     physical stores have to meet it in order to remain relevant. We estimate that designing a more
     frictionless customer experience could produce $150 billion to $250 billion in cost savings.

     AI-powered interfaces and geofencing can point shoppers to the products they want and
     remember their preferences, for example. Improved connectivity and the growing affordability
     of the underlying technologies set the stage for deployment on a much larger scale.
     Augmented reality can help shoppers understand exactly what they are buying and how it
     will perform in different environments; it could even enable customers to sit back and try on
     clothes with interactive mirrors.

     One of the most promising conveniences would be eliminating checkout. RFID scanners,
     payment beacons, and computer vision can enable shoppers to walk out of stores and
     pay seamlessly for the merchandise they are carrying. Their accounts can be charged
     automatically without waiting in checkout lines. Checkout optimization, powered by trackers,
     AI, and machine learning, could generate up to $125 billion to $200 billion in cost savings.




52   McKinsey Global Institute


Enhanced personalization: Advanced connectivity can also support a new level of
personalization in retail. Using advanced connectivity to deliver a high-tech personal
experience in stores could increase revenue by $230 billion to $400 billion.

Personalization can boost total sales by 15 to 20 percent. 82 Yet a recent McKinsey survey
found that fewer than 10 percent of companies were pursing such strategies in a systematic
way beyond their digital channels. Doing this in stores represents a significant opportunity.
Covergirl, for example, has created a flagship store with “glam stations” for trying different
cosmetics virtually by applying them to the shopper’s own image. 83

Real-time personalized promotions in stores could be implemented in several ways.
Associates can use customer insights to create personalized offers (perhaps relying on next-
product-to-buy algorithms). Personal shoppers can use AI tools to propose very targeted
product recommendations based on omnichannel data. Alternatively, location data and
biometric sensors can be used to guide customers to the products they are looking for; it can
also push offers to customers when they travel within proximity of a store. All together, these
opportunities can increase foot traffic into stores and then direct customers to personalized
offerings, and altogether lead to up to $140 billion to $230 billion in increased sales.

Implications for the retail domain

The retail domain has already experienced significant disruption from online retail and
cross-domain players. Traditional retailers are being forced to move quickly, add new
digital capabilities, and revitalize the store experience. There is likely to be an increasing
gap between large players with the scale and financial capacity to own major parts of the
technology required to support their operations and relatively smaller players.

Across individual markets, retail competitors are likely to have the same access to advanced
connectivity. The differentiating factors will be the development of applications and solutions
as well as the capabilities integrated by retailers themselves. In a world with advanced
connectivity, retailers are sorting into three categories, with different levels of capital
availability and technical capabilities (Exhibit 13).

Among large-scale players, the online pioneers are well positioned to integrate cutting-
edge technologies into their value chain. They have the computational power (and the talent)
to use new types of advanced analytics to segment customers at an increasingly granular
level and better address their needs. Amazon, for instance, is even playing an outsized role
in providing technology solutions to others across the ecosystem, including via AWS with
AI-powered applications and block-chain solutions. Online incumbents that want to expand
a physical presence can build strong customer data platforms to bridge between online
and offline channels, freeing them to focus on investment and staffing. They could even
sell these platform solutions as a service to other players in the value chain (although not
retail competitors).

The second category is made up of large traditional players. Although they are not digital
natives, they are still well positioned to implement use cases. They have the scale necessary
to derive real value from data capture and applications, but they may need to develop a
stronger technology backbone and beef up capabilities to do so. These companies can
make acquisitions or form partnerships to gain in-house applications quickly. Some of the
largest companies are aiming to develop their own integrated ecosystem along the lines
of what the largest online pioneers have created. Kroger, for instance, acquired the data
analytics subsidiary of Dunnhumby (now 84.51°); it integrated the data capture and analytics
capabilities in its own operations and also monetizes this service to suppliers. 84 Other players

                                      might turn to external providers for their technology needs. Some are partnering with
                                      connectivity and technology service providers to develop systems and applications based on
                                      their specific needs and parameters, which could include store and geographic specifications,
                                      customized applications, or anticipated implementation challenges. The retailers in this group
                                      can take advantage of their brick-and-mortar footprint by piloting and testing use cases, then
                                      implementing them at scale across their store networks.

                                      Subscale players have to find alternative strategies. They have limited access to capital and
                                      may lack tech capabilities, but they can adopt turnkey solutions from external providers.
                                      Entering into service agreements with outside providers could be an option to keep the
                                      capital investment manageable; another could be creating partnerships to test concepts.
                                      Companies like Pensa Systems rent on-shelf inventory monitoring services that use drones
                                      and computer vision. Standard Cognition can set up checkout-free payment systems in any
                                      retail store with the company devices and AI. There is also room for intermediaries to offer a
                                      “one-stop-shop” service, bundling multiple offerings into turnkey solution suites for retailers.
                                      Smaller retailers might be able to use their investments in tech innovation to differentiate
                                      themselves and take their in-store experience to the next level, with technologies like virtual
                                      fitting rooms, which could also optimize inventory.

Issues to be addressed

To make technology investments pay off, use cases need to be implemented across the board,
not at one point in the value chain. For example, using RFID tags and detectors exclusively
for in-store inventory management would produce only a fraction of the value that could
be generated by an integrated solution spanning from distribution centers to on-premises
stock rooms, on-shelf smart replenishment processes, and check-out optimization. Retailers
historically have tended to consider their capital investments, benefits, and cost structures
in silos. They will need to overcome any lack of internal alignment and look for holistic
implementation strategies, making the required investment at the company or group level.

To bring digital into stores and achieve this vision of connectivity, retailers need access to
the right technology at an affordable price. Margins are thin in retail, and cost has been a
major barrier to date. Only 40 percent of retailers have posted rising gross margins and EBIT
margins over the past few years. Looking at the top and bottom quartile of retailers, margin
performance is the main differentiating factor that stands out. From a cost perspective,
retailers tend to invest in technologies that will generate returns on investment within a three-
year timeframe, limiting heavy spending on others that are more speculative and may take
longer to pay off.

Even if cost considerations are addressed, retailers tend to be limited in their willingness to
make big bets due to the constant pressure on earnings and margins. McKinsey research has
found that 80 percent of retailer investments continue to be in legacy areas. Many tend to test
initiatives on a limited scale and roll them out slowly; vendors, too, are largely still in the pilot
phases. The challenge will be creating an integrated technology vision and pursuing it on a
large scale.

Implementing use cases with systems involving facial recognition, location tracking, or instant
payment needs careful thought, with strong safeguards around data security and privacy.
Some customers may embrace the convenience of personalized offers and instant payment,
but others are wary and may be put off. Regulation will define the rules, and since it may
vary by region, it can introduce complexity for retailers and hinder the deployment of some
use cases.

                                      keeping businesses from realizing the full potential of connectivity use cases are not new—
                                      and cannot be overcome with technological progress alone.

                                      In a world where future economic growth depends on finding new avenues for improving
                                      productivity, the hurdles slowing both network deployment and the widespread adoption of
                                      use cases urgently need to be addressed. In this chapter, we discuss some of the issues that
                                      surfaced in our analysis of mobility, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. While the barriers
                                      vary somewhat in each commercial ecosystem, some common themes emerge. We have
                                      categorized these broader issues into five groups (Exhibit 14). They include both demand-
                                      side challenges (such as use cases that require coordination between different entities)
                                      and supply-side challenges (such as misalignment of risks and incentives in deploying
                                      connectivity infrastructure).

                                      These are thorny and persistent issues. But they are not impossible to overcome, and
                                      initiatives are already under way to address some of them. In this chapter we identify some of
                                      the hurdles and potential solutions.

Harnessing demand coordination and aggregation
Use cases in any single commercial domain may involve coordinating multiple actors (from
firms in different industry verticals to government agencies). Many of them do not regularly
communicate and collaborate today. Now they may need to align on common technical
standards for systems to work—and these standards are still evolving, even in the most
developed markets. In most countries, governments can play a coordinating or convening
role, but the private sector shoulders most of the weight of solving these issues and forming
smoothly functioning ecosystems.

In health care, for instance, remote monitoring has clear benefits for patients, but it involves
medical institutions, med tech providers, payors, and public agencies. Common protocols,
standards, and reimbursement models will need to be defined. In mobility, vehicle-to-
infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle warning systems involve public infrastructure
providers, rival automotive manufacturers, connectivity providers, technology players, and
equipment manufacturers.

These are only two of the use cases with complex interdependencies. There is a real
possibility that connectivity providers could build the network infrastructure, but adoption
may not follow if coordination fails. The time and resources involved in this coordination adds
to the cost of the infrastructure itself. The risks are magnified in domains where the capital
requirements are especially high.

The coordination challenge is magnified by the fragmented nature of the many potential use
cases. The value that can be produced with enhanced connectivity is substantial across
an entire economy, but it is spread across hundreds of use cases and many industries—
and together, they may represent only a relatively small fraction of total value in a given
domain. Since the demand is so fragmented, no single actor is able to drive momentum and
stakeholders may not see enough value potential to engage. In addition, these use cases are
not always core priorities for industry players, especially those who are not as far along in their
digital transformation journey.

All of this can contribute to companies taking a wait-and-see approach or stalling in a never-
ending “pilot purgatory.” Retailers and manufacturers, for example, could both benefit from
advanced computer vision, but the value it could produce may not be significant enough for
companies in these sectors to clamor for someone to deliver these services right away.

Addressing these issues may require companies to rethink business models and their roles
in their respective value chains. There is an opportunity for an actor to play a coordinating
role, galvanizing multiple stakeholders across broader ecosystems to move forward toward
a common goal. It is unclear who will lead the way and connect the dots across various
domains—but such an actor could potentially address both coordination and fragmentation.
Large multinationals, industry groups, national and local governments, and other major
industry actors such as health systems can play a role in aggregating demand and
leading cooperative efforts. Tech giants and connectivity providers themselves may also
be candidates.

A number of telecom companies worldwide are beginning to play this type of role in smart
city partnerships. In the mobility space, many key players in the automotive and smartphone
industries have formed the Car Connectivity Consortium to collaborate on setting global
standards for in-vehicle connectivity. 85 In some regions, and in some domains providing public
goods, governments may step in. In Singapore, Singtel, Ericsson, and Singapore Polytechnic
partnered to establish the 5G Garage, a networked facility where providers, business
customers, and other stakeholders can collaborate and test out use cases; its goal is to help
launch a wider 5G ecosystem. 86

     Misaligned incentives can slow down adoption in commercial domains
     In the commercial domains we studied, there are several examples of misaligned incentives.
     The company that takes on the cost of upgrading assets and systems and does the heavy
     lifting of implementation may not be the one that captures the most value, or even extracts
     value commensurate with the risk. For some use cases, it is unclear exactly who will capture
     the value.

     For instance, healthcare innovations running on enhanced connectivity could improve patient
     outcomes and improve efficiency. But while hospitals and health systems need to invest, add
     new talent, and change the way they work, much of the ultimate financial benefit could go
     to insurers, patients, and the public sector. To solve this issue, some insurers are starting to
     partner and invest.

     The same story could play out for connectivity providers. Misaligned incentives have the
     potential to slow future rollouts and upgrades. Connectivity providers are often the actors
     who must put up substantial risk capital to build advanced networks, but they are not
     necessarily positioned to reap the benefits. Consumer internet, media, and advertising
     companies have long profited from offering “over-the-top” services that run on networks built
     and maintained by connectivity providers, but the providers themselves have struggled to
     monetize this activity in a proportional way.

     For established companies and start-ups alike, attempting to re-align market incentives (or
     profit from the status quo) can be a gamble that would require significant upside opportunity
     to merit the risk. However, the far-reaching economic and social benefits of certain use cases
     may be significant enough to compel public-sector actors to play facilitator for those actors
     who dare to take a chance. The options and levers available to governments to help overcome
     these challenges vary by country, depending on its ambitions, available resources, and other
     trade-offs such as those related to competition or consumer protection policy.

     One potential solution is directing more public funding into basic R&D to encourage
     experimentation. 87 Another may be regulatory solutions to improve the investment case
     for connectivity providers. For example, on the cost side, network sharing stands out as
     a solution that has proven successful with previous generations of cellular connectivity.
     It is expected to have even stronger potential with 5G, by reducing the cost of small cell
     deployment significantly while enabling device and equipment manufacturers to achieve
     better economies of scale. 88

     Some governments have used direct support and subsidies to address incentives. China,
     for example, has made huge investments in its fixed and cellular networks for the past
     several years with the aim of offering 5G in all major cities and switching a quarter of mobile
     subscriptions to 5G by 2025. Korea’s “5G Plus” strategy includes $27 billion in tax breaks
     and government investments by 2022. 89 Other direct support initiatives include subsidizing
     equipment, providing tax incentives, and funding 5G R&D and testbeds. In other countries,
     subsidies may be necessary to address the urban-rural divide. In the United States, the
     Federal Communications Commission plans to devote $20 billion to improving mobile
     connections in rural areas.90

Rapid adoption of use cases depends on resolving concerns around data
privacy and security, ownership, and interoperability
The economic value of connectivity is closely linked with the value of data flows. Use cases
that promise radical personalization of products (such as in retail) or that drive productivity
through machine-to-machine communication (such as in manufacturing) rely on the collection
of large, rich, and specific data about consumers and businesses. Widespread adoption of
these use cases requires assuaging individuals’ valid concerns about privacy, and businesses’
concerns about data confidentiality and integrity. Adoption also requires addressing data
security risks, ranging from unauthorized access to personal or business data to the safety of
physical assets controlled by connectivity-enabled IoT solutions.

Data ownership rights and interoperability concerns are also potential hurdles to adoption,
especially with IoT applications.91 Data interoperability can be potentially addressed by
encouraging open standards, or by building platforms that can translate between different
data formats. But in addition to interoperability, adoption of use cases also requires that all
participants in a commercial domain have a common understanding of ownership rights to
data produced by various connected devices. For instance, who has the rights to health data
from a patient’s monitoring device—the patient, the provider, the device manufacturer, or
some other party? Who gets to decide how this value should be shared? Such concerns are
not limited to healthcare: they extend to use cases that we analyzed in manufacturing, retail,
and mobility domains as well.

One potential path to overcoming data complexity hurdles is to create common data
standards. Industry associations, technology suppliers, and policy makers can collaborate
to create such standards. Translation/aggregation platforms are also needed to manage
communication among different applications. They can enable the uses cases described and
unlock the value at stake.

In addition to defining interoperability standards achieving the potential of connectivity
requires improvements in security and methods for ensuring privacy, protection of intellectual
property, and assignment of data ownership. Policy makers can play a key role in these areas
as they are intertwined with many areas of regulatory and government responsibility.


The speed of deployment is influenced by factors such as financial
constraints, regulatory uncertainty, and legacy assets
Some of the issues holding back progress include legacy barriers and financial constraints.
Domain players and connectivity providers alike may have an extensive legacy asset base
that will be expensive to upgrade. Even among B2B players such as retailers, manufacturers,
or wholesalers, adopting connectivity-enabled use cases can be delayed by long capital
investment cycles. In the past decade, many firms have postponed asset upgrades due to
weak growth and an uncertain investment outlook.

Regulatory uncertainty also needs to be resolved around broad issues as well as domain-
specific questions in areas such as mobility and healthcare. For connectivity providers,
practical constraints like spectrum availability, access rights to public infrastructure,
and power density limits are persistent challenges that often have to be overcome at the
local level.

The realities of enhancing and rolling out networks are substantial, but connectivity providers
are not alone in rising to the task. Governments have a stake in accelerating network buildouts
and upgrades to capture the productivity benefits and achieve more inclusive growth. Policy
makers cannot solve all of the issues, but they can address some of the barriers.

     Spectrum availability is one, as unused spectrum blocks within the priority bands for 5G
     deployment are increasingly hard to find. Policy makers will need to carry out the task of
     relocating other applications outside those priority bands. They can also facilitate and
     encourage spectrum sharing between connectivity providers and with other applications.

     Governments can also establish clear and thoughtful legal frameworks around controversial
     topics such as power density limits and access rights to public infrastructure for densified
     network installations. This could remove some of the uncertainty surrounding the feasibility,
     cost, and returns of rollout—and once connectivity providers gain clarity, they will be more
     inclined to move ahead.92 In addition, specific issues need regulatory certainty to clear the way
     for implementation in areas such as healthcare and mobility.

5. The connectivity gap
   across countries
  Even if most of the market issues described in Chapter 4 are resolved, the business case for
  building advanced and frontier networks looks very different across countries. It also varies
  sharply between urban and rural areas, even within the most promising national markets for
  frontier connectivity.

  Barring any major intervention from policy makers or other investors, connectivity providers
  will naturally limit their network build-outs to those areas where they can make their capital
  investment pay off. They will have to weigh the expected revenue and profitability, the cost
  of capital, population density, the cost of deployment per capita, and more. Connectivity
  providers will have to prioritize their broader portfolio of capital expenditures, assessing
  the share they allocate to enhanced connectivity in light of the multiple technology cycles
  they must sustain. Their financial health, their annual spending levels, and the maturity of
  the market for advanced and frontier connectivity will determine each country’s timeline
  for rollout.

  The countries that are in the forefront today can expect superior performance and new
  capabilities that will remain out of reach for trailing countries. Connections everywhere will
  become faster and more reliable over the next decade, but not to the same degree. By 2030,
  we estimate that roughly 80 percent of the global population could have advanced coverage
  or better, with a quarter of the world’s population covered by high-band 5G networks.


  When it comes to connectivity, every country is not equal
  We define four country archetypes based on a number of factors: revenue dynamics, such
  as average revenue per user and level of data usage; cost dynamics, such as the quality and
  extent of existing telecom infrastructure as well as urban density; and market dynamics,
  including differences in regulation and competition.

  Based on these characteristics, we classify countries into four distinct groups:

  — Pioneers: These countries, typified by Japan, South Korea, and the United States, have
    consistently led the pack in connectivity. They are starting to deploy high-band 5G in
    select parts of major cities.93 They will likely remain in the forefront, thanks to mature fixed
    infrastructure and the relatively strong financial positions of operators.

  — Leaders: Countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Canada are
    consistently close behind the pioneers. But operator investment may be constrained in
    these markets since price competition has reduced margins. Their providers generate
    lower average revenue per user than their peers in pioneer markets.94

  — Followers: Countries such as Brazil, Turkey, and Poland, are about two to four years
    behind the pioneers, but advanced and especially frontier networks are likely to be limited

          to major urban cores only. Like operators in leader markets, those in follower countries
          may find it harder to support the large capital investment required to build sophisticated
          networks. As a result, existing fixed infrastructure is often inadequate, even in urban
          areas. Over the next decade, the focus in follower countries is likely to be on advanced
          mobile networks (low- to mid-band 5G) and the expansion of fiber. Depending on the
          affordability of service, LEO satellites could bridge coverage gaps in rural areas.

     — Trailing markets: Many African nations fall into this category, as well as Iran and Bolivia.
       These countries tend to have limited basic connectivity infrastructure and are unlikely to
       deploy advanced mobile networks in the near term. That said, their populations have lower
       data usage—and moving later may help them benefit from improved economics. Although
       LEO satellites may provide connectivity options for most of the population, the cost of
       deployment and the affordability of user devices will limit its accessibility.

     In addition to these four archetypes, two countries emerge as unique cases:

     — China: Over the last several years, China has poured huge amounts of capital into its
       fixed and cellular networks, building highly sophisticated and densified underlying
       communication infrastructure. The nation continues to roll out and enhance advanced
       technologies over this backbone at a faster rate than any other country. It is expected
       to invest another $145 billion in 5G over the next five years with the aim of offering it in
       all major cities and switching more than a quarter of Chinese mobile subscriptions to 5G
       networks by 2025.95

     — India: India is digitizing faster than any trailing market. Previous MGI research estimated
       that the number of internet users could hit 800 million by 2023.96 Although it is
       modernizing and expanding mobile networks, their performance metrics are likely to lag
       for most of the population, except a few key metro areas. Deployment of fixed networks
       will be challenging since low subscription prices limit commercial viability. It will likely
       take price increases or government action to spur buildout. For instance, the government
       has been supporting the BharatNet program, which is about halfway toward its goal of
       bringing high-speed broadband to India’s 250,000 villages.97


     The connectivity divides separating the four country groups are likely to
     persist, and even grow, over the next decade
     The type and extent of connectivity infrastructure ultimately deployed will vary from one
     country to another, and even within the same country. While providers in pioneer markets are
     starting to roll out high-band 5G in select urban areas, they will most likely start with low- to
     mid-band 5G in many places, then upgrade the infrastructure as the market matures and
     demand increases. Providers in trailing countries will most likely invest in offering low- to mid-
     band 5G to the biggest share of the population they can manage. In each country, the revenue
     potential, the costs of labor and equipment, urbanization, and the provider’s own financial
     capacity will determine the viability of investments—and result in different coverage rates.

     The economics work for providers to cover some 80 percent of the world’s population
     (approximately 7 billion people) with low- to mid-band 5G networks by 2030, although the
     level of quality will vary. We estimate that this expansion of coverage could come at a total
     cost of some $400 billion to $500 billion. This deployment will rely heavily on existing 4G
     infrastructure but would offer upgraded capabilities that can support most (but not all)
     use cases.

Deploying a true high-band 5G network over the millimeter wave spectrum requires more
tailored infrastructure—and greater investment. Connectivity providers would need to densify
their radio access network, upgrade the 5G core network, and upgrade network operating
systems to offer the full capabilities in terms of speed, latency, and device density. We
estimate that they will need to invest $700 billion to $900 billion to bring this type of coverage
to 25 percent of the global population. These networks are likely to be limited to select
geographies for the foreseeable future.

In a number of countries, fiber networks have been built out with public subsidies where they
were not economically viable for connectivity providers.98 Over the next decade, the build-out
of advanced fixed networks will still be limited by its own business case. Barring support from
other public or private stakeholders, the world’s fiber coverage should grow to around 50 to
55 percent of the population, up from today’s coverage levels of 40 to 45 percent.

As a result of these differences across countries, the connectivity divide across segments
could widen (Exhibit 15). The differences are stark when it comes to high-band 5G. Thanks to
extensive existing radio access and backhaul infrastructure and providers with strong capital
positions, up to 50 to 55 percent of the population in pioneer countries and China could have
coverage by the end of the decade. By contrast, frontier networks might reach between 5 to
15 percent of the population in trailing markets and India.

On the fixed side of things, the story is quite different. Pioneer countries and China already
enjoy a higher rate of fiber network coverage than the rest of the world, leaving little room for
growth. Leaders are likely to post modest growth over the decade. But follower markets are
starting with relatively low fiber coverage of less than 30 percent, and a significant number
of unconnected areas are dense enough to create a solid business case for connectivity
providers. We estimate that coverage in these markets could double as they pursue catch-
up growth. Trailing markets and India are similarly starting with low coverage rates, even
in dense areas, but they are unlikely to follow suit due to the limited revenue potential
that is foreseeable today.99 Fixed networks might only be available to about 10 percent of
the population.

Even within individual countries, we see a rural-urban gap forming. Many rural areas will
gain improved service but will not enjoy the same level of network performance as cities
(Exhibit 16). By 2030, some 80 to 85 percent of urban dwellers worldwide—but almost none
of the global population in rural areas—could have frontier connectivity coverage. This is even
wider than the urban-rural gap in current LTE coverage.100 The divide within trailing countries
could be especially stark, reflecting differences in both prosperity and density between the
urban and rural populations.

With the previous generation of networks, providers typically aimed for nationwide or near-
nationwide coverage. But the high costs of building out 5G, combined with the projections
for incremental revenue, means that they will have to take a more targeted approach.101 Yet in
certain dense urban areas with very high per capita data consumption, providers may find that
the network efficiency benefits alone justify deployment as they cope with growing device
density and data traffic. Many rural areas, however, simply do not have the density nor the
business presence to support the capital investment that is needed; the cost per customer
served is simply too high. Closing these divides would require the public sector, or other
private investors to step in to support rural coverage to ensure more inclusive access.

                                    The distribution of economic value associated with use cases is likely to
                                    be uneven across country groups, thereby expanding economic gaps
                                    The $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion of value at stake in the four commercial domains we studied will
                                    not be divided evenly across country archetypes (Exhibit 17). The countries at the forefront
                                    could capture a disproportionate share of the value, while trailing countries could fall further
                                    behind—and the distribution is especially skewed when it comes to frontier use cases.

Exhibit 17

The value produced by use cases running on advanced and frontier connectivity could be
distributed unevenly.

                                    These differing outcomes stem from the expected availability of advanced and frontier
                                    connectivity. Looking at anticipated coverage rates across archetypes reveals a far more
                                    pronounced gap for frontier connectivity than for advanced. This division is even more
                                    significant when considering coverage in urban areas, since these areas ultimately contribute
                                    the largest share of GDP.

                                    capture slightly more value than other archetypes, relative to their projected contribution to
                                    2030 global GDP. At the other end of the spectrum, India and trailing markets are expected to
                                    capture a smaller share of value than their expected contribution to global GDP in 2030 would

indicate.102 Leader and follower markets stand to capture economic benefits at a rate that
is largely in line with the share of global GDP they produce. In terms of figures, we estimate
that 60 to 65 percent of the value could go to pioneer markets and China, 20 to 25 percent to
leader markets, 10 to 15 percent to followers, and just 5 percent to India and trailing countries.
The share going to China and pioneers would exceed their weight in the global economy
by 10 to 20 percent, while the share going to India and trailing markets would fall quite a
bit below.

For frontier connectivity use cases, the dispersion of value is more striking. We estimate that
70 to 75 percent would go to China and pioneer markets, 15 to 20 percent to leaders, 5 to
10 percent to followers, and only 2 to 5 percent to India and trailing countries. China stands to
capture an outsized share that could be 40 to 50 percent higher than its share of global GDP,
while the share going to pioneer markets could be 20 to 30 percent higher. This mainly results
from the fact that these nations are highly urban, with GDP concentrated in those urban areas.
On top of that, China is already deploying new networks rapidly. However, the story is not as
positive for the rest of the world. With lower urban concentration and more incremental gains in
connectivity, leaders might capture a share that is 20 to 30 percent lower than the size of their
economies would indicate, with followers punching at 30 to 40 percent below their weight.
Trailing countries and India come in at 70 to 80 percent below their share of global GDP.


Bringing more of the world online could help narrow the connectivity
gap and economic gap between country groups
Although mobile adoption has increased significantly over the past few years, some
40 percent of the global addressable population remains unconnected to 3G-capable
networks or better. That means some 2.5 billion people are still offline.103 Addressing this
divide is an important issue for economic and human development. In fact, providing
“universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries” is one of the
UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Some 400 million people around the world, mainly in the rural areas of trailing countries,
are not covered by any network and so have no access. But the absence of networks is not
the only issue. Some 2 billion people are covered by networks but are not using the mobile
internet due to other barriers. These include the affordability of devices and data plans,
readiness (including illiteracy and lack of digital skills), and the relevance of online content.

Even without connectivity advances, demographic and economic shifts appear likely to draw
a billion more people online by 2030. First, population growth alone, at current adoption
rates, should add 400 million new mobile internet users.104 Second, urbanization will likely
bring 150 million currently unconnected rural inhabitants to urban areas with better job
opportunities and better network coverage (although high birth rates in rural areas of
developing countries will partly counter this trend).105 Third, rising household incomes should
enable 450 million people to afford devices or data plans for the first time (at current prices).106
Finally, improvements in literacy and digital skills should equip 300 million people to go
online.107 Yet some people who meet these prerequisites will not feel the internet’s pull, largely
due to a lack of relevant content (particularly content in their own language).


102
      It should be noted that significant value and GDP gains are possible in India and trailing markets from a range of use
      cases enabled by the expansion of intermediate connectivity, along with foundational digital identification infrastructure
      and digital payment systems. See Digital India: Technology to transform a connected nation, McKinsey Global Institute,
      March 2019; and Digital identification: A key to inclusive growth, McKinsey Global Institute, April 2019.

      We define the “unconnected” population as individuals over 11 years of age who do not use mobile internet (3G or later
      technology). Some of these individuals have access to voice networks, so they are sometimes referred to as “under
      connected” in the economic literature. But for our purposes, since this population has no data connectivity and no
      Internet access, they are effectively “unconnected”—particularly in the context of the advanced and frontier connectivity
      technologies that are the focus of this report.

                                        On top of the demographic and economic trends described above, another 800 million
                                        to 1 billion people could come online as a result of improving availability, affordability, and
                                        relevance. Network rollouts and upgrades, especially in the rural areas of trailing countries,
                                        are expected to shrink the coverage gap to only 4–6 percent of the global population. The
                                        affordability gap should shrink to affect only 6–14 percent of the population if the prices of the
                                        cheapest smartphones continue to fall and connectivity providers can offer cheaper entry-
                                        level data plans for low-income customers. Finally, local content and services will develop over
                                        time, enticing more people online to access them.

                                        As a result of all these developments, the share of the global addressable population
                                        remaining offline should be reduced by half, falling from 40 percent today to 20 percent by
                                        2030. Despite this progress, more than 300 million people, mostly in rural areas of trailing
                                        countries, could still lack network coverage (Exhibit 18). Furthermore, around 1 billion people
                                        could remain offline due to the persistence of the affordability, relevance, or readiness
                                        barriers discussed above.

                                     Connectivity providers face a tough road ahead
                                     Gaining a better view of how connectivity might evolve over the next decade naturally requires
                                     a closer look at the providers that will put the world’s new digital backbone in place. The
                                     telecom industry of yesterday, with high barriers to entry and few competitive challenges, is
                                     a thing of the past.109 Disruption is coming from multiple angles, including the entry of new
                                     players and even price wars in some markets.

                                     The rollout of advanced and especially frontier connectivity demands major investment—at
                                     a time when mature markets are saturated, competition is leading to price wars, and wireless
                                     plans are becoming commoditized.

                                     Differences in the economics of each market will influence how and where providers decide
                                     to invest, as described in the previous chapter. From today through 2025, those in pioneer
                                     markets are projected to spend up to $1,000 per capita while those in trailing markets could
                                     invest only $20 to $30 per capita. Some of this gap is due to varying labor, land, and material
                                     costs, but much of it comes down to companies investing where they see higher revenue

     potential and more favorable conditions for deployment. While providers in pioneer markets
     and China have already invested heavily in infrastructure and are well-positioned to build on
     their head start, those in the rest of the world will collectively need to find additional revenue
     sources to cover the costs of enhanced networks sustainably.

     The ability of providers to shoulder heavy capital investment in the coming years depends not
     only on the opportunities but on their financial health (Exhibit 20). Those in leader markets
     (particularly in Europe) have experienced stagnant growth and increased price competition.
     From 2012 to 2018, revenues for the group as a whole fell by 14 percent in a period when
     capital investment increased by almost one third, leading to significant fall in free cash flow.
     This puts these companies in a tougher position as they contemplate the need to continue
     increasing capital investment by 6 percent annually over the coming five-year period.110

     Providers in follower countries have posted stable revenues amidst increasing capital
     expenditure. But they have been able to capture operational efficiencies and make strong
     improvements in their cash flow.

     Those in trailing countries and India had revenue growth of 43 percent and 8 percent,
     respectively, from 2012 to 2018. But their cash flow growth did not keep pace. Connectivity
     providers in India, in particular, face unique challenges. Some carriers have invested heavily
     in 4G and LTE infrastructure while cutting the price of their services dramatically. This has left
     the entire industry under pressure, with capital investment exceeding EBITDA in 2018.

     Over the next five years, we expect to see providers in pioneer countries continue with steady
     increases in capital investment of around 1–3 percent annually (up to $1,000 per capita).111
     Those in pioneer countries and China have already undertaken major buildouts, and they
     should be carried by strong sales growth and operating cash flow.

     In the future, markets that have already invested heavily in laying the infrastructure
     foundations necessary for advanced cellular connectivity will likely be able to maintain
     stable ratios of capital investment to earnings. But the rest of the world will face difficult
     choices as they strive to catch up while producing positive returns. Providers with “unhealthy”
     capital intensity have limited options to reverse these trends. Those in leader, follower and
     trailing markets are projecting limited additional growth, and as a result, they will have to find
     additional revenue streams or revisit pricing (Exhibit 21).

     Some of that additional revenue can come from connecting currently offline populations,
     as discussed earlier. Providers in trailing markets and India can substantially expand their
     subscriber bases, but they will have to overcome their current monetization issues to gain
     significant revenue from these new consumers.

     One illuminating exercise to show the disparity in provider outlooks across markets is to
     translate revenue required to fund investments into relative growth rates and compare
     them to projected revenues over the next decade in different markets. Providers in leader
     markets would need to reverse their negative to zero projected growth and achieve at least
     a 1 to 1.5 percent positive annual growth rate. These figures contain a world of differences,
     however. The leader countries most affected by price competition would need to achieve at
     least a 3 to 4 percent annual growth rate. Those in follower markets must more than double
     their projected annual growth rates from roughly 2 to 5 percent to make capital investments
     sustainable. Providers in trailing markets would need to boost growth from 1 to 2 percent to
     2.5 percent. In India, it will take growth of 5.5 to 6 percent, well above the currently projected
     4.5 percent. These growth requirements would cover only expected increases in capital
     investment, not spectrum licensing and other expected operating costs.

6. Questions for
   the future
  Our research to date has confirmed the value of connectivity, identified specific use cases and
  barriers, and modeled how connectivity is likely to evolve across regions. But the outlines of
  this new connected world are still coming into focus, and many uncertainties remain. This is a
  complex transformation with many moving parts.

  This discussion paper represents our initial exploration into how connectivity will affect
  individual industries and broader economies. A number of issues merit further exploration,
  both on the supply side and within additional domains beyond the ones covered here. Some
  of these questions are posed below—and we hope to tackle some of them as part of our
  ongoing research.


  Can connectivity providers solve the monetization puzzle?
  The first set of questions is related to connectivity providers and how they can capture more
  of the economic value from the infrastructure they provide.

  As they seek to build out and upgrade networks, these companies face challenges on the
  financial, regulatory, competitive, and business model fronts. The need to stay current could
  leave many in a difficult situation as they face the realities of their financial and market
  positions. How they choose to approach these challenges will determine how the new world of
  connectivity evolves.

  Can they adjust their pricing strategies and add adjacent specialized services while staying
  within their traditional value chain? What is the potential for network slicing (offering virtual
  pieces of their network with different technical specifications), service-level pricing (to
  monetize ultra-low latency), or network sharing (forming partnerships to share the fixed costs
  of deployment with other providers)?

  How can providers partner with businesses in other domains to create viable long-term
  strategies? Such partnerships are becoming more important in other domains that are also
  facing heavy capital investment needs, including those analyzed in this research. Over time,
  could providers claim a bigger partnership role in developing innovations such as connected
  vehicles, remote healthcare, or the Internet of Things?


  What will the connectivity ecosystem look like in a decade’s time?
  A second set of questions revolves around what types of new players might become
  connectivity providers. As noted in Chapter 5, telecom operators may be joined by satellites,
  tower and infrastructure companies, and tech companies.

  How likely is it that today’s traditional telecom operators will continue to provide the backbone
  of connectivity architecture for years to come? What about in the “last mile” of connectivity
  services? As commercial demand for industrial 5G use cases grows, for example, industrial
  players and hardware providers may consider building out the “last mile” services in the form
  of private networks.




  Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                          73


     Similarly, other technology companies that play in the same ecosystems and offer adjacent
     services may also consider expanding into connectivity services. Some internet companies
     have explored moving into this space (most notably Google, which has launched fixed, cellular,
     and ISP offerings such as Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Loon).112 Other technology players are
     eyeing opportunities in IoT connectivity (such as Amazon Sidewalk).113 How different will the
     provider ecosystem look across different regions by 2030?


     How might the technical architecture of different domains evolve?
     Beyond infrastructure implications for connectivity providers, the technical architecture of
     specific domains is evolving. Enhanced connectivity may open opportunities to rethink where
     and how computing happens, especially when it is combined with advances in computing
     (such as cloud, edge, and quantum computing), device and sensor efficiency, storage, and
     software design. Connectivity providers and technology companies alike are already hurrying
     to identify potential new offerings through partnerships, as evidenced by Amazon and
     Verizon’s recent 5G Edge computing partnership.114 These changes could have meaningful
     implications for the full technical stack of companies and across entire domains.

     To what extent do we expect to see meaningful change within the existing architecture? In
     which domains will the biggest changes occur?

     These questions and more will provoke interesting discussions about the future of
     infrastructure, application development, the broader technology product and service provider
     industries, and the capabilities that will drive the technology sector of the next decade.


     Meet the new consumer, same as the old consumer?
     Another set of questions relates to consumers. Will the same issues of monetization and
     misaligned incentives that exist in advanced markets be repeated with the new consumers
     coming online for the first time across the developing world? What new economic value will
     these consumers unlock, and what opportunities will be created for businesses?

     Additional questions center around those high-use consumers who already drive the majority
     of the world’s data consumption and will likely continue to do so by decade’s end. We expect
     to see massive growth in online viewers and also more time spent viewing per user. Given
     consumers’ seemingly insatiable demand for higher-quality video and more sophisticated
     gaming applications, can providers convert this demand to value through advanced and
     frontier connectivity? Much of the consumer demand today is highly skewed, with 20 percent
     of consumers being “power users” who are responsible for the majority of the usage. Will new
     consumer applications, including augmented and virtual reality, change this pattern or skew
     it even further? The answer may depend on the extent to which consumer applications go
     beyond media and entertainment into other domains such as education and services.


     What kind of potential and barriers exist in other parts of the economy?
     A related area for further research centers around the value and barriers in other commercial
     domains. Beyond the four analyzed in this report, we identified another 13 commercial
     domains that also hold significant potential, ranging from logistics and services to mining
     and agriculture.

How much more economic value can they generate? How different are their use cases from
the ones considered in this research, and can most of them similarly be executed using
currently available technologies?

Across the board, we observe that the adoption of use cases has been largely localized
or limited to pilots, with little to no broad, at-scale adoption. This suggests that some
combination of hurdles may be to blame for this lack of momentum. Beyond the barriers
identified in this research, do other domains have additional, specific issues due to their
market dynamics, incentives, or regulations?


What is the role of policy?
Lastly, the role policy makers will take in shaping the connected world of the future
remains unclear.

At the global level, for instance, what effect will recent technology “decoupling” trends
between the United States, China, and other countries have on supply chains, technology
standards, and end-user adoption?

At the country level, this research has identified four archetypes (plus China and India) that
we expect will evolve differently due to differences in demand, infrastructure, and economic
viability. But government action can change these dynamics in ways that are difficult to
foresee. To date, governments around the world have taken markedly different approaches
in facilitating the expansion and evolution of connectivity. In some markets, governments
have played a very hands-on role through direct investment and subsidies for connectivity
providers. Some are investing heavily in R&D. Others are taking a more hands-off role, simply
facilitating the broader connectivity market through actions like spectrum auctions.

In addition to these levers, regulations on topics such as spectrum sharing and power density
will have major implications for where, when, and how the value of enhanced connectivity will
be realized.

     1. Estimating data demand
     To consider how internet data traffic is likely to grow through 2030, we use projected growth
     rates through 2022 from the Cisco Visual Networking Index and then extrapolate for the
     remaining years through 2030. We validated our growth assumptions, finding them highly
     similar to estimates from other sources such as the Ovum Network Traffic Forecast (2018-
     2023).

     We take a similar approach to determine how data traffic is likely to be split across
     various dimensions:

     — To determine projected growth for each country archetype, we use country-level and
       regional growth rates through 2022 from the Cisco Visual Networking Index, combine
       results using our archetype classification, and extrapolate for the remaining years until
       2030 using the compound annual growth rate from 2017 to 2022, excluding the effect of
       growth in the number of internet users.

     — To project the split between network types, we use growth rates from the Cisco Visual
       Networking Index through 2022 and extrapolate through 2030.

     — To project the split between different types of applications (such as online video and
       gaming), we use growth rates from the Cisco Visual Networking Index through 2022,
       extrapolate the development of each application type through 2030, and normalize by the
       growth of total internet data traffic.

     — To project the split between different types of devices (such as smartphones and
       machine-to-machine devices), we use growth rates from the Cisco Visual Networking
       Index through 2022, extrapolate the development of each device type until 2030, and
       normalize by the growth of total internet data traffic.

2. Estimating the GDP impact of use cases
We calculate the GDP impact of the use cases in four domains (mobility, healthcare,
manufacturing, and retail), as described below, then extrapolate to the rest of the economy
while differentiating between highly digitized and less digitized industries.



In addition to building on our modeling of impact in these four domains, we rely on the
following data sources:

— We use IHS Markit’s Global Industry Service data for GDP and gross output projections
  over the period spanning 2018 to 2030, by industry. This covers 75 countries that
  collectively account for approximately 93 percent of the world’s GDP.

— We use the International Labor Organization’s as source for employment data, by industry
  and by occupation segment. This includes 10 occupation segments (e.g., managers,
  clerical support workers, etc.) and covers only 64 countries; therefore, it is primarily used
  to inform the split within each industry between occupational segments.

To calculate the GDP impact from enhanced connectivity within an industry, we differentiate
between three types of use cases:

— For use cases that create new revenue opportunities, we derive the related GDP impact
  in 2030 by multiplying the sized revenue in 2030 by the industry’s ratio of gross output
  minus cost base to gross output in 2030, as follows:




— For use cases that create cost savings, we consider the related GDP impact in 2030 to be
  equal to the sized cost saving value in 2030.

— For use cases involving a spending reduction in industries such as healthcare (e.g., public
  and out-of-pocket healthcare spending), we derive the related GDP impact by multiplying
  the sized savings in 2030 by the industry’s ratio of GDP to gross output in 2030,
  as follows:




For each use case, we also identify the main occupation involved in creating value. This
allows us to determine the contribution of each employment segment to the GDP impact from
advanced connectivity in the four industries profiled in detail. We then apply this extrapolation
to other industries, comparing the ratio of each occupational segment in the employment
base of the sized industries to that of the remaining industries.

The extrapolation also accounts for the relative level of digitization of other industries as
compared with the sized industries. The remaining industries are split into two sets: those
with a high Digitization Index score and those with a lower score.115 The impact that advanced
connectivity brings to each of these two sets of industries is proportional to the ratio of their
Digitization Index score to that of the sized industries.

The distribution of the GDP impact by type of connectivity (advanced and frontier) results
from a bottom-up classification of the four industries’ use cases. This is then distributed
by country archetype based on anticipated coverage rates and the concentration of
urban population.

3. Estimating the value associated with use cases in mobility
We estimate the revenue opportunities and cost savings that could be generated by a defined set of use
cases relating to mobility, then extrapolate to arrive at the value at stake in the broader industry.

We rely on a number of key sources. For penetration rates and the number of cars in operation, we use
projections from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility.116 For the individual use cases, we conducted
interviews with industry experts and relied on data from sources including Statista, the American
Automobile Association, and the US Department of Transportation.

For each use case, we define the revenue or cost savings stemming from either advanced or frontier
connectivity on a yearly, per-car basis. We consider five use cases:

— Infotainment: We estimate potential subscription prices in audio, video, and gaming for both
  standard streaming and advanced services.

— Predictive maintenance: We estimate the unit revenue arising from the ability to monitor a vehicle’s
  systems and send it to a preferred service provider when it needs maintenance. For such systems
  running on advanced connectivity, we further calculate the potential cost reduction for preemptively
  avoiding major breakdowns and smooth it over the life-cycle of the vehicle to get a yearly unit price.

— Connected parking: We estimate the revenue going to parking operators from recommendations
  through vehicle software. For frontier connectivity, we further expand the revenue pool with the
  potential income from car-pooling services.

— Vehicle-to-vehicle warning systems: We calculate the per-car cost reduction from avoiding
  hazards such as potholes and black-ice patches and the corresponding savings on maintenance
  and repair.

— Connected surroundings: We calculate the potential for improved navigation services based on the
  input from connected infrastructure and the device revenue from automatic road pricing systems.

For each use case, we interviewed industry experts to vet our assumptions and arrive at a realistic range
of “take rates.” We combined this with unit prices and the market penetration of each level of connected
vehicle (basic, intermediate, and advanced) projected to be on the road in 2030.

To extrapolate across the broader industry, we used a McKinsey database covering more than
80 connectivity use cases. We scaled up by assuming that the use cases above are the five most
valuable and then using the ratio of the top five to the total value pool from the 2016 Car Data
Monetization publication. We further corrected for the larger size of the new use case catalog to ensure
that we cover new applications of connectivity technology appearing in the past three years.

4. Estimating the value associated with use cases in healthcare
We estimate the global efficiency potential from 10 specific healthcare use cases enabled
by various levels of connectivity. Our analysis relies on previous research conducted by
McKinsey’s Healthcare practice and the McKinsey Global Institute, as well as interviews with
digital and healthcare experts.

For each use case, we define how the adoption levels of advanced and frontier connectivity
vary across country archetypes. We forecast what could be achieved across base and stretch
scenarios based on previously defined potential for digital solutions from the Digitizing
healthcare model.117 We apply the potential to projected levels of healthcare spending based
on an MGI model that forms the basis of an upcoming report titled The health of nations.

We look at the most value-adding use cases in detail:

— Remote patient monitoring: We determine what value can be created by using advanced
  remote monitoring solutions for patients with chronic diseases, in terms of avoiding or
  reducing hospitalizations and minimizing primary care and specialist in-person visits.

— Decision support solutions: We estimate the savings associated with accelerated
  diagnoses, the prevention of errors and complications, identifying the most effective
  treatment protocols, and offering more personalized treatment plans.

— Integrated command center: We identify the efficiency opportunities associated with
  improved patient flows, optimal workforce scheduling, and optimized inventory and
  bed management.


5. Estimating the value associated with use cases in manufacturing
We analyze five specific use cases running on advanced and frontier connectivity in
manufacturing industry to estimate the additional value they can create.

Our analysis relies on IHS Global Industry Service data for market size estimates and on the
MPI Group manufacturing benchmark for cost base estimates. We also conducted interviews
with industry experts and used previous McKinsey analyses to estimate the value unlocked by
each use case.

— Automated guided vehicles (AGVs): We determine the share of warehouse tasks related
  to moving parcels and pallets that currently require human intervention but could be
  performed by fully autonomous AGVs.

— 3-D bin picking: We estimate the share of labor dedicated to the preparation of parts
  on production line conveyors that can be streamlined with advanced robotics and
  computer vision.

— System-wide real-time process control: We determine the potential for quality
  improvements associated with the implementation of real-time process control systems
  based on the current average cost of downtime and defects in the manufacturing industry.

— Augmented reality: We estimate the productivity improvement resulting from the use of
  augmented reality in R&D, production, and logistics based on the current average labor
  cost associated to these three activities.

     — Vision quality checks: We assess the baseline and the potential for improvement in the
       earlier detection of defects and the productivity gains resulting from the implementation
       of automated visual inspection on the production line.

     For each of these use cases, we take the total potential value identified as described above,
     then apply “take rates,” accounting for the level of applicability by sub-industry and across
     advanced and emerging economies. We conducted interviews with industry experts to vet
     our assumptions and build these rates, which, when applied to the potential maximum savings
     identified for each use case, gave us the estimated cost savings achievable.


     6. Estimating the value associated with use cases in retail
     We analyze ten specific use cases in the retail industry to estimate the revenue and / or cost
     savings they could produce, running on either advanced or frontier connectivity. Our analysis
     relies on Euromonitor and Forrester data for market size projections by channel and category
     as well as interviews with industry experts and previous MGI research.

     — Next-generation warehouse management: We assessed three key activities (receiving,
       put-away, and picking) and determined for each how much time could be saved if
       products, boxes, and pallets were equipped with trackers for automatic scanning
       and location.

     — Real-time visibility during transportation: We determined how much of the total cost of
       goods sold is lost during inbound transportation from manufacturer to distribution center,
       identified the main root causes of loss, and determined what share these losses could be
       reduced with tracking systems at different points in the transportation journey.

     — Out-of-stock mitigation: We identified the current weighted average in-stock rate
       across retailers, then determined the room for improvement vs. best-in-class players
       using automated tracking systems. Based on this delta, we estimated how much
       additional revenue could be captured.

     — Shrinkage reduction: We identified the average shrinkage rate across retailers, the main
       root causes (e.g., theft), and the total value of goods lost. We then determined how much
       of this could be reduced with advanced tracking systems and computer vision systems
       and calculated the savings.

     — On-shelf inventory tracking: We identify the share of labor cost associated with in-store
       inventory management and how much of this time is dedicated to auditing in particular.
       Then we determined how much of this time could be reduced with tracking systems,
       on-shelf sensors, and computer vision to estimate the associated cost savings.

     — Optimizing working capital: Using a weighted average cost of capital, we estimate the
       cost keeping inventory. Then we determined the potential reduce in inventory costs that
       could be realized with end-to-end product visibility enabling more accurate forecasts to
       size the cost savings.

     — Optimizing check-out: We identified the average labor time spent on cashier activities
       and then identified how much could be reduced by connectivity-enabled solutions such as
       computer vision paired with automatic payment systems.

     — Next-generation in-store merchandising: We identified how much time is spent
       in stores on directing customers and estimated how much could be replaced with
       connectivity-enabled systems and interfaces to calculate labor cost savings.

— Real-time personalized promotions: Based on previous research and category
  analyses, we estimated the potential sales increase that could be generated by real-time
  personalized promotions utilizing geo-fencing push notifications, computer vision with
  face recognition, and other connectivity-enabled solutions.118

— In-store personalized recommendations: Based on previous research and category
  analyses, we estimated the potential sales increase that could be generated by real-time
  personalized recommendations using advanced analytics, customer data, computer
  vision, and connected interfaces.

For each of these use cases, we then interviewed industry experts to vet our assumptions
and define a “take rate,” including the applicability in urban and rural areas of both developed
and emerging countries (based on their expected future share of retail sales) as well as the
applicability of each use case by category (based on that category’s expected share of retail
sales). Each use case has two take rates: one for solutions running on advanced connectivity,
and one for solutions that require frontier connectivity. Checkout optimization, for example,
can unlock more value when run on frontier connectivity, but it has a lower take rate due to
implementation and capital constraints.


7. Defining country archetypes
We sort countries into four distinct groups based on where they stand in the connectivity
continuum and their likely trajectory in the decade ahead. We consider factors including
the average revenue per user, level of data usage, the quality and extent of existing telecom
infrastructure, urban density, and market dynamics including regulation and competition. Our
analysis relies on the following sources:

— Average revenue per user: GSMA Intelligence for cellular, Analysys Mason for fiber

— Share of urban vs. rural population and land size: World Development Indicators,
  World Bank

— Current cellular coverage levels by technology (e.g., 3G, 4G): GSMA Intelligence

— Cellular data traffic volumes: Analysys Mason

— Current fixed coverage levels by technology (e.g., fiber, DOCSIS 3.0): IDATE DigiWorld,
  Analysys Mason

— GDP per capita: World Bank

Within each group, we have singled out representative countries to analyze in more detail in
our calculations for deployment, demand, adoption, GDP impact, and value distribution. The
in-depth results for these sample countries are then extrapolated to the broader group.

We define four categories: pioneers (with Japan and the United States as the representative
countries chosen for more detailed analysis), leaders (with Canada, France, Germany, and
Thailand as representative countries), followers (Brazil, Poland, and Turkey), and trailing
markets (with Pakistan and Nigeria as representative countries). Exhibit A1 offers a broader
list of the countries that fall within each archetype.

In addition, China and India are treated as unique cases.

8. Estimating the cost of deployment and future coverage
We calculate the cost of deploying advanced and frontier connectivity and the coverage rates
likely to be achieved by 2030 for both fixed and cellular. Our global estimates are derived
by considering representative countries within four archetypes (as described above), then
extrapolating the results to the broader set of countries within that group. China and India are
considered separately. The extrapolation is based on the cost of connectivity deployment per
capita estimated for representative countries in urban, suburban, and rural areas, either fixed
or cellular. This cost is then multiplied by the total archetype population in urban, suburban,
and rural areas.

It is important to note that our projected coverage rates are based on determining
economically viable operator investments. It excludes any potential investments from other
private or social investors and any public support.

Our analysis relies on the following data sources:

— Population forecasts by country from the United Nations

— Share of urban vs. rural population and land size from the World Bank’s World
  Development Indicators

— Labor rates from The Economist Intelligence Unit

— Current cellular coverage levels by technology (e.g., 3G, 4G) from GSMA Intelligence

— Current fixed coverage levels by technology (e.g., fiber, DOCSIS 3.0) from IDATE and
  Analysys Mason

— Existing number of cellular sites from OVUM’s World Cellular Information Service

— 5G penetration forecasts by country (GSMA Intelligence data)

— Cellular data traffic volumes from Analysys Mason

— Average revenue per user from GSMA Intelligence for cellular, Analysys Mason for fiber

— Cellular and fixed capital expenditure projections from OVUM, GSMA Intelligence, and
  Analysys Mason

For fixed coverage, our calculation is based on fiber deployment costs by household, both in
terms of labor and equipment, and the population to be covered in each country.

— We account for the variations between countries in labor costs by using The Economist
  Business Intelligence Unit data

— We account for variations between countries in equipment costs by attributing an
  equipment index to each country estimated by a panel of industry and geography experts

— Our calculation differentiates the cost of covering urban, suburban, and rural households,
  which vary due to household density and deployment distances.

— Once the total required investment is calculated, we consider the maximum coverage level
  beyond which deployment is no longer economically viable for operators. This threshold
  is expressed in terms of minimum household density. It is based on the expected average
  revenue per user from fiber and the lifetime of fiber infrastructure as well as the weighted
  average cost of capital and EBITDA margins for local operators. This minimum density




Connected world: An evolution in connectivity beyond the 5G revolution                         83


         level is then converted into the percentage of households that are economically viable
         to cover.

     — Finally, we model capital expenditure through 2030, considering the capital expenditure
       projections for fixed connectivity from OVUM and the share of the capital expenditure
       that is expected to be allocated to advanced connectivity (estimated by interviews with
       industry experts). We assume that connectivity providers will deploy first in urban centers,
       followed by suburban and then rural areas.

     For cellular coverage, we similarly calculate the total investment in radio access networks
     required to achieve full advanced connectivity. This is defined as the level at which the
     entire population, in the inhabited land to have geographic radio access network coverage
     with the demand for data traffic fully met. The data traffic criteria is based on the average
     data consumption per capita in each country and a ratio of average to peak to account for
     variations in data traffic. To determine the required investment, we consider the following for
     both advanced and frontier connectivity rollout:

     — The labor and equipment costs include those to install new cell sites and cell towers and to
       connect them with fiber backhaul.

     — As with fixed coverage, our calculation differentiates the cost of covering urban, suburban,
       and rural households, which vary due to population density.

     — We calculate the number of cell sites and cell towers needed to offer the full coverage
       in urban, suburban, and rural areas, taking into account the data-carrying capacity and
       range of cell sites. Both of these parameters depend on the connectivity level deployed
       and spectrum used. The use of millimeter wave for high-band 5G results in much lower
       cell site range and data-carrying capacity than mid-range 5G. In addition, we factor for
       variations in these ranges depending on whether the infrastructure is rolled out in urban,
       suburban or rural environments. As for the number of towers deployed, we take into
       account the tower-sharing practices between different operators, with the percentage of
       shared towers estimated by a panel of industry and geography experts.

     — Once the total required investment in radio access networks is calculated, we determine
       the maximum coverage level beyond which the deployment is no longer economically
       viable. This threshold is expressed in terms of minimum population density. It is based
       on the expected average revenue per user and the lifetime of cellular infrastructure, as
       well as the weighted average cost of capital and EBITDA margins for local operators.
       This minimum density level is then converted into the percentage of population that is
       economically viable to cover.

     — In the case of frontier connectivity (high-band 5G) deployment, we also modeled the
       investment needed to upgrade the core network, operating support systems, and
       business support systems. Our model incorporates data from Analysys Mason for 2020-
       25, which we have extrapolated to 2030.

     — Finally, we model capital expenditure through 2030, considering the yearly capital
       expenditure projections for cellular connectivity providers and the share of that to be
       dedicated to building the backhaul and radio access network. This provides the yearly
       investment pool available for deploying cellular networks. To account for the new
       generation’s maturity in each market, we then index the share of that yearly pool to be
       allocated to 5G networks to the future penetration of 5G devices.

     — We assume that connectivity providers will start by offering advanced coverage, before
       deploying the more sophisticated frontier coverage. Also, we assume that connectivity
       providers will prioritize network rollout based on density; they will therefore cover urban
       centers first, then suburban areas, then rural areas.

9. Assessing connectivity providers’ future capacity for investment
We assess the prior financial performance of connectivity providers in selected countries
and estimate their future ratio of capital expenditure needs to expected revenue. In markets
where that ratio exceeds 15 to 20 percent (and therefore is likely unsustainable), we then
calculate the additional revenue needed to sustain this capital expenditure.

This analysis relies on two main data sources:

— For individual operators, we use the top three to five operators by revenue in each of the
  representative countries in our archetypes (described above in section 7). We examine
  their financial statements from annual reports to form a dataset of performance from
  2012 to 2018. This covers some 95 percent of the market in these countries.

— For country-level data and forecasts, we use collected information on CAPEX and revenue
  projections from GMSA Intelligence.

To identify and size revenue gaps, we divide EBITDA by revenues for each country in
2017–18 and apply these to total revenue income in 2018. We then use capital expenditure
projections from GSMA Intelligence to determine how the ratio of capital expenditure to
revenue varies. To obtain the total deficit, we calculate the value of the gap by applying this
ratio to projections and summing the yearly gaps over the period 2019 to 2025.

To calculate the additional revenue needed to keep the required level of capital expenditure
below between 15 and 20 percent of yearly revenues, we first use the above calculated total
deficit α and revenues in 2018 and 2019. We solve for the revenue in 2025 if linear growth
gains an extra α, by letting                      , knowing R18 already. We plug in the
R25 usual CAGR formula and get

                                CAGR


10. Estimating the share of the population that will remain offline
by 2030
We project the share of population that will remain underconnected (i.e., those who will not
adopt 3G or better cellular connectivity) by 2030.

The main data sources used for the analysis are:

— GSMA Intelligence (cellular connectivity data)

— eMarketer (online video viewer and social network user data)

— United Nations Population Division (population and urbanization data)

— IHS Markit (GDP projections)

— McKinsey’s Cityscope database (income differences between urban and rural areas)

— Analysys Mason (revenue per GB trends)

— IDC Device Tracker (selling prices of smartphones)

— Oxford Economics (country-level income distributions)

— ITU (cheapest mobile data plans)

— A4AI (cheapest mobile data plans)

     — Tariff (cheapest mobile data plans)

     — Operator websites (cheapest mobile data plans)

     Projections for the share of population remaining unconnected in each country are based
     on barrier analysis, which focuses on four main barriers to mobile internet adoption, namely
     availability, affordability, relevance, and readiness:

     — Availability: To project intermediate cellular coverage by 2030, we use country-level
       projections from GSMA Intelligence through 2025, then extrapolate through 2030, while
       taking into account the projected rate of urbanization (more people moving to areas
       already covered by mobile networks).

     — Affordability: To project the affordability of mobile internet use, we consider three
       developments: the distribution of household incomes, the price of the cheapest 4G
       smartphones, and the monthly cost of the cheapest entry-level mobile data subscriptions.
       To determine household income distribution in each country, we use Oxford Economics
       projections. To determine the price of the cheapest smartphones, we use the price of
       the cheapest 3G smartphones during the 4G lifecycle as a proxy for the pattern that 4G
       smartphone prices are likely to follow during the 5G lifecycle. To determine the cheapest
       entry-level mobile data plans, we consider two scenarios: In the first scenario, entry-level
       data plan prices would decrease as a result of decreasing costs per GB. In the second
       scenario, entry-level data plan prices would decrease in tandem with the average revenue
       per user in each country.

     — Relevance: To project the relevance of content, we use two proxies: the number
       of online video viewers and social media users in each country. We use eMarketer
       projections through 2022 (online video viewers) and 2023 (social media users), then
       extrapolate through 2030. We take into account slowing growth rates in countries with
       high penetration.

     — Readiness: To project readiness for mobile internet usage by 2030, we use two proxies:
       literacy and mobile phone ownership (digital literacy). For literacy, we use current and
       historical country-level literacy rates from UNESCO and extrapolate through 2030 using a
       population pyramid model that takes into account the differences in literacy rates of each
       age group.

     To combine the results, we take the availability of coverage as the first limiting condition. We
     then consider the existence of other barriers and overlap between them, based on information
     on the current unconnected population, and then calculate unconnected population for each
     year between 2019–30 based on the trends described above.
