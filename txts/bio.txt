McKinsey Global Institute

Since its founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought to
develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the business
and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims to help leaders in
the commercial, public, and social sectors understand trends and forces shaping
the global economy.
MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, employing
the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business leaders. Our
“micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic industry trends to
better understand the broad macroeconomic forces affecting business strategy
and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have covered more than 20 countries
and 30 industries. Current research focuses on six themes: productivity and
growth, natural resources, labor markets, the evolution of global financial markets,
the economic impact of technology and innovation, and urbanization. Recent
reports have assessed the digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on
employment, physical climate risk, income inequality, the productivity puzzle, the
economic benefits of tackling gender inequality, a new era of global competition,
Chinese innovation, and digital and financial globalization.
MGI is led by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: co-chairs James
Manyika and Sven Smit, and director Jonathan Woetzel. Michael Chui, Susan Lund,
Anu Madgavkar, Jan Mischke, Sree Ramaswamy, Jaana Remes, Jeongmin Seong,
and Tilman Tacke are MGI partners, and Mekala Krishnan is an MGI senior fellow.
Project teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows and
include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These teams draw
on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and management experts.
The MGI Council is made up of McKinsey leaders and includes Michael Birshan,
Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, André Dua, Kweilin Ellingrud, Tarek Elmasry,
Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Acha Leke, Gary Pinkus, Oliver Tonby,
and Eckart Windhagen. The Council members help shape the research agenda,
lead high-impact research and share the findings with decision makers around
the world. In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, advise MGI
research.
This report contributes to MGI’s mission to help business and policy leaders
understand the forces transforming the global economy and prepare for the next
wave of growth. As with all MGI research and reports, this work is independent
and reflects our own views. This report was not commissioned or paid for by any
business, government, or other institution, and it is not intended to promote the

     In brief



     The Bio Revolution
     A confluence of advances in biological sciences—decades in the making—with
     the accelerating development of computing, automation, and artificial intelligence
     (AI), is fueling a new wave of innovation that could have significant impact on
     economies and societies, from health and agriculture to consumer goods and
     energy. These new capabilities and applications are already improving our
     response to global challenges from climate change to pandemics; at the time
     of writing this report, they were being used to help respond to the COVID‑19
     pandemic. But these innovations come with profound risks, arguing for a serious
     and sustained debate about how this innovative wave should proceed. This report
     assesses progress in these innovations, their potential for economic and societal
     impact, and the risks involved. Key findings include the following:

     — Increasing ability to understand and engineer biology. Recent advances
       include a sharp drop in the cost of sequencing DNA and the emergence of
       new techniques (including CRISPR) to edit genes and reprogram cells. So far,
       innovation in four arenas stands out: (1) biomolecules—the mapping, measuring,
       and engineering of molecules; (2) biosystems—the engineering of cells, tissues,
       and organs; (3) biomachines—the interface between biology and machines; and
       (4) biocomputing—the use of cells or molecules such as DNA for computation.
       All show various rates of progress from demonstration to commercial use.

     — Transformative new capabilities. These innovations are creating five new
       potentially transformative capabilities: (1) biological means could be used to
       produce a large share of the global economy’s physical materials, potentially
       with improved performance and sustainability; (2) increased control and
       precision in methodology is occurring across the value chain from delivery to
       development and consumption with more personalization; (3) the capability
       to engineer and reprogram human and nonhuman organisms is increasing,
       potentially improving disease prevention and treatment as well as agricultural
       performance; (4) new methodologies using automation, machine learning,
       and proliferating biological data are enhancing discovery, throughput, and
       productivity in R&D; and (5) potential is growing for interfaces between
       biological systems and computers to, for instance, restore sensory function to
       the brain, and for biocomputers that could use DNA to store data.

     — Substantial potential direct and indirect impact. As much as 60 percent
       of the physical inputs to the global economy could, in principle, be produced
       biologically—about one-third of these inputs are biological materials (wood or
       animals bred for food) and the remaining two-thirds are nonbiological (plastics
       or fuels) but could potentially be produced or substituted using biology.
       Therefore, it is possible that bio innovations could impact up to 60 percent of
       physical inputs, although attaining that full potential is a long way off. Even
       modest progress toward it could transform economies, societies, and our lives,
       including what we eat and wear, the medicines we take, the fuels we use, and
       how we construct our physical world. In human health, at least 45 percent of
       the current global disease burden could be addressed using science that is
       conceivable today.

— Visible pipeline of applications. Around 400 use cases, almost all
  scientifically feasible today, can be observed, mainly in human health and
  performance; agriculture, aquaculture, and food; consumer products and
  services; and materials, chemicals, and energy production. These use cases
  alone—more than half of which fall outside human health—could have direct
  economic impact of up to $4 trillion a year over the next ten to 20 years. The full
  potential could be far larger if we take into account potential knock-on effects,
  new applications yet to emerge, and additional scientific breakthroughs.

— Unique risks that require debate and mitigation. New biological capabilities
  come with profound and unique risks that need serious, ongoing debate,
  and proactive, rather than reactive, approaches toward mitigation. One
  such risk is that biological systems are self-sustaining, self-replicating, and
  interconnected, with potentially cascading and long-lasting effects on entire
  ecosystems or species; once Pandora’s box is opened, we could have little
  control over what happens next. Access to these tools may be relatively cheap
  and easy, making the potential for misuse considerable. Privacy and consent
  issues abound due to new forms of biological data. Responding to such
  challenges through cooperation and coordination may be complicated given
  competitive and commercial incentives and varying jurisdictional or cultural
  value systems.

— The timing of applications’ adoption and impact hinges on multiple
  factors. Adoption timelines, and therefore impact, will vary depending on
  several factors, including society’s approach to risks. There are three stages
  in the journey from lab to market: scientific research, commercial availability,
  and diffusion at scale. Science needs investment and to be proven. Resulting
  applications need to offer a value proposition against existing offerings,
  and able to be scaled. Diffusion and eventual impact will depend on public
  sentiment and mechanisms governing the use of different applications. About
  70 percent of the total potential impact could hinge on societal attitudes and
  the respective mechanisms employed to govern use, such as regulations and
  societal norms.

— Stakeholders and contributors need to inform themselves about the Bio
  Revolution. Innovators, businesses, governments, and citizens need to
  become bio-literate in order to respond effectively to ongoing bio innovation,
  weighing risk against reward. The choices they make will influence the size and
  scope of the Bio Revolution’s benefits for economies, societies, and the planet.

Executive summary
Nearly seven decades after the double helix structure of a DNA molecule was discovered,
the world of biology appears to have reached a new phase of growth. A flurry of recent
innovations—such as CRISPR–Cas9 to edit genes and stem cell advances to reprogram
cells—are providing new understanding, new materials, and new tools, as well as lower
costs. The science is so advanced, for example, that in 2016, a Human Cell Atlas project was
kicked off to create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells as a basis for research,
diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Moreover, as a result of the scientific advances,
a growing number of applications are emerging from the lab and being put to commercial use.1

The potential for beneficial economic and social impact seems enormous. As much as
60 percent of the physical inputs to the global economy could, in principle, be produced
biologically. Our analysis suggests that around one-third of these inputs are biological
materials, such as wood, cotton, and animals bred for food. For these materials, innovations
can improve upon existing production processes. For instance, squalene, a moisturizer used
in skin-care products, is traditionally derived from shark liver oil and can now be produced
more sustainably through fermentation of genetically engineered yeast. The remaining two-
thirds are not biological materials—examples include plastics and aviation fuels—but could, in
principle, be produced using innovative biological processes or be replaced with substitutes
using bio innovations. For example, nylon is already being made using genetically engineered
microorganisms instead of petrochemicals. To be clear, reaching the full potential to produce
these inputs biologically is a long way off, but even modest progress toward it could transform
supply and demand and economics of, and participants in, the provision of physical inputs.
Biology has the potential in the future to determine what we eat, what we wear, the products
we put on our skin, and the way we build our physical world.

Human health is one of the most significant domains where biological advances are being
applied. Biology is already helping save lives through innovative treatments tailored to our
genomes and microbiomes. In the future, we estimate that almost half of the global disease
burden could be addressed through applications that are scientifically conceivable today.
Moreover, many of the innovations born of these bio innovations contributed to the global
response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020 (see Box E1, “An April 2020 snapshot
of early contributions by bio innovations in the fight against COVID‑19,” at the end of this
executive summary).

    DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid, an organic chemical found in all cells and in many viruses. DNA acts as the main
    carrier for genetic information. CRISPR-Cas9 stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
    and CRISPR-associated protein 9. This tool uses a small piece of ribonucleic acid (RNA) with a short “guide” sequence
    that attaches to a target sequence of DNA and to the Cas9 enzyme. The Cas9 enzyme cuts the targeted DNA at the
    targeted location, which enables genetic material to be added or deleted. In the rest of this report, we refer to the tool as
    CRISPR. RNA is a biopolymer consisting of ribose nucleotides (nitrogenous bases appended to a ribose sugar molecule)
    connected and forming strands of varying lengths. Unlike most DNA molecules composed of two biopolymer strands,
    RNA typically is a single-stranded biopolymer. RNA molecules play essential biological roles, from translating genetic
    information encoded in DNA molecules into the cellular structures and molecular machines (that is, proteins) to regulating
    the activities of genes. A stem cell is a type of cell in a multicellular organism that has two capabilities: self-renewal by
    producing indefinitely more cells of the same type, and the ability to give rise to many other kinds of cells in the body by
    differentiation.

    Many other domains, from agriculture to energy, could also benefit from biological processes
    and products. Biology could even be deployed to mitigate climate change, by helping reduce
    net man-made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

    However, the risks from these innovations are profound and unique. Biological systems
    self-replicate, are self-sustaining, and are highly interconnected; changes to one part
    of a system can have cascading effects and unintended consequences across an entire
    ecosystem or species. Accidents can have major consequences—and, especially if used
    unethically or maliciously, manipulating biology could become a Pandora’s box that, once
    opened, unleashes lasting damage to the health of humans, ecosystems, or both. The risks
    are particularly acute because many of the materials and tools are relatively cheap and
    accessible. Moreover, tackling these risks is complicated by a multiplicity of jurisdictional and
    cultural value systems, which makes collaboration and coordination across countries difficult.

    This report, which draws on a wealth of academic and technical research, takes a detailed
    look at how advances in biological science and their practical application could transform
    our economy and society. We have compiled a library of about 400 visible use cases that,
    while not comprehensive, nonetheless point to the domains that could be most directly
    affected—and hint at the potential economic value that could be created. We also focus
    on the considerable challenges that will need to be overcome to turn biology’s economic
    potential into reality in scientific research, commercialization, and diffusion. By our estimate,
    more than two-thirds of the total impact could hinge on consumer, societal, and regulatory
    acceptance of these applications. A new era is dawning that we refer to as the Bio Revolution.
    Like all periods of economic and technological disruption, it is an era of both great opportunity
    and considerable uncertainty.


    Bio innovation is occurring in four key arenas
    A wave of innovation is being enabled by advances in biological sciences accelerated by
    developments in computing, data analytics, machine learning, AI, and biological engineering.
    We group innovations into four arenas: biomolecules, biosystems, biomachine interfaces, and
    biocomputing (Exhibit E1).2




    2
        Our definition of biomolecules for this report covers the mapping and measuring of intra-cellular components (for
        example, DNA, RNA, and proteins) in the study of omics. We also include the engineering of intra-cellular components
        (for instance, genome editing). Our definition of biosystems covers engineering at the cell, tissue, or organ level,
        including stem-cell technologies and transplantation use cases. Biomachine interfaces is a field of biology defined as
        the connection of nervous systems of living organisms to machines, including in brain-machine interfaces. Biocomputing
        is a field of biology defined as using cells and cellular components for computational processes (storing, retrieving, or
        processing data).

                                      Major breakthroughs in each of the four arenas are reinforcing one another. In biomolecules
                                      and biosystems, advances in omics and molecular technologies—the mapping and
                                      measuring of molecules and pathways within cells, and engineering them—are enhancing our
                                      understanding of biological processes, as well as enabling us to engineer biology (Exhibit E2). 3
                                      For example, CRISPR technology allows scientists to edit genes more quickly and precisely
                                      than previous techniques. Advances in biomachines and biocomputing both involve deep
                                      interaction between biology and machines; it is becoming increasingly possible to measure
                                      neural signals and power precise neuroprosthetics. 4 It is now also possible to store the world’s
                                      wealth of data using DNA—by some measures one kilogram of DNA could hypothetically store
                                      all current data in the world. 5

                                      Worldwide DNA sequencing now creates huge volumes of biological data every year.6
                                      These technical advances, such as lower-cost sequencing or high-throughput screening,
                                      have helped lower the costs of entry, accelerate the pace of experimentation, and generate
                                      new forms of data to help us better understand biology. Advances at the single-cell level,
                                      such as single-cell imaging tools and single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, are
                                      allowing scientists to build increasingly high-resolution maps of cells, which can be a basis
                                      for research, diagnosis, and treatment. Increasingly, the ability to understand and engineer
                                      biological processes exists across a variety of dimensions.

                                      Mapping the genome is a foundational building block. This dates to the Human Genome
                                      Project, a 13-year, $3 billion journey to map the entire genetic makeup of humans, that began
                                      in 1990.7 Accordingly, genomics is the most technologically advanced branch of omics, and
                                      has the most related applications either in development or already in use. 8 But other omics
                                      are necessary complements, and work on them is increasing. However, the power of the map
                                      of the human genome began to materialize only when sequencing DNA became cheaper
                                      and faster. The cost of DNA sequencing is now decreasing at a rate faster than Moore’s Law
                                      (Exhibit E3).9 In 2003, mapping the human genome cost about $3 billion; by 2019, it was less
                                      than $1,000. Within a decade or even sooner, the cost could be less than $100.10

    New biological capabilities could bring about transformational change in
    economies, societies, and our lives
    New biological capabilities have the potential to bring sweeping change to economies
    and societies. The effects will be felt across value chains, from how R&D is conducted to
    the physical inputs in manufacturing to the way medicines and consumer products are
    delivered and consumed. These capabilities include the following:

    — Biological means could be used to produce a large share of the global economy’s
      physical materials, potentially with improved performance and sustainability.
      Significant potential exists to improve the characteristics of materials, reduce
      the emissions profile of manufacturing and processing, and shorten value chains.
      Fermentation, for centuries used to make bread and brew beer, is now being used
      to create fabrics such as artificial spider silk. Biology is increasingly being used to
      create novel materials that can raise quality, introduce entirely new capabilities, be
      biodegradable, and be produced in a way that generates significantly less carbon
      emissions. Mushroom roots rather than animal hide can be used to make leather.11 Plastics
      can be made with yeast instead of petrochemicals.

    — Increased control and precision in methodology is occurring across the value
      chain, from delivery to development and consumption with more personalization.
      Advances in biological sciences have made R&D and delivery processes more precise
      and predictable; the character of R&D is shifting from discovery by accident to rational
      design. Increasing knowledge of human genomes and the links between certain genes
      and diseases is enabling the spread of personalized or precision medicine, which can be
      more effective than the one-size-fits-all therapies of the past.12 Precision also applies to
      agriculture, where insights from a plant or soil’s microbiome increasingly can be used to
      optimize yield as well as to offer consumers with, for instance, personalized nutrition plans
      based on genetic tests.13

    — The capability to engineer and reprogram human and nonhuman organisms is
      increasing. Gene therapies could offer complete cures of some diseases for the first time.
      The same technical advances that are driving capabilities that improve human health can
      be used to introduce valuable new traits that, for instance, improve the output or yield
      of nonhuman organisms like microbes, plants, and animals. Crops can be genetically
      engineered to produce higher yields and be more heat- or drought-resistant, for instance.
      By permanently genetically altering the vectors spreading disease (such as mosquitoes),
      gene drives could be used to prevent vector-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue
      fever, schistosomiasis, and Lyme disease, although they also come with ecological risks.14

    — New methodologies using automation, machine learning, and proliferating
      biological data are enhancing discovery, throughput, and productivity in R&D.
      Biology and computing together are accelerating R&D, thereby addressing a productivity
      challenge. McKinsey analysis in 2017 found that the ratio of revenue to R&D spending in
      the biopharmaceutical industry hit a low point in productivity between 2008 and 2011.15
      An explosion of biological data due to cheaper sequencing can be used by biotech
      companies and research institutes that increasingly are using robotic automation and

     sensors in labs that could increase throughput up to ten times.16 Further, advanced
     analytics, more powerful computational techniques, and AI can be leveraged to provide
     better insights during the R&D process.

— Potential is growing for interfaces between biological systems and computers. A new
  generation of biomachine interfaces relies on close interaction between humans and
  computers. Such interfaces include neuroprosthetics that restore lost sensory functions
  (bionic vision) or enable signals from the brain to control physical movement of prosthetic
  or paralyzed limbs. Biocomputers that employ biology to mimic silicon, including the use
  of DNA to store data, are being researched. DNA is about one million times denser than
  hard-disk storage; technically, one kilogram of DNA could store the entirety of the world’s
  data (as of 2016).17

While these are early days, the scope and scale of these emerging capabilities could have
a broad impact on economies and societies, touching multiple domains both directly and
indirectly. These applications may change everything from the food we consume to textiles to
the types of health treatments we receive and how we build our physical world. The potential
value is vast. As noted, as much as 60 percent of the physical inputs to the global economy
could be produced biologically, and even modest progress toward that 60 percent number
could be transformative.

Beyond the physical world, innovations could transform prevention, diagnostics, and
treatment of disease. At least 45 percent of the global disease burden could be addressed
with capabilities that are scientifically conceivable today, according to our analysis.

Bio innovations, such as high-throughput screening, CRISPR, and machine learning for
analyzing large and complex biological data, have also begun to shape R&D. We estimate that
roughly 30 percent of private-sector R&D in major economies is in industries where biological
data, biological inputs, or biological means of production could be used.18

The full impact remains some way off in the future. But already, it is possible to identify some
key applications and domains where these technologies could be deployed. Over the past five
to ten years, proof-of-concept experimentation has increasingly emerged from the lab and
moved into the marketplace. Many applications, particularly in health and agriculture, are now
in the commercialization phase. Products from materials to chemicals are being substituted
by alternatives produced and processed using biological means that are often more efficient
and, in many cases, put less pressure on the environment. While the early direct impacts
of biological technologies are for now primarily concentrated in certain domains, such as
human health and agriculture, they could spread downstream to other sectors and society
more broadly.


A visible pipeline of applications can deliver profound impact across a
wide range of domains in the next two decades
To examine a wide range of applications, we compiled a library of about 400 use cases. They
constitute an already-visible pipeline for the years ahead. Our library included use cases that
are scientifically conceivable today and that could plausibly be commercialized by 2050.
We excluded use cases that are not scientifically conceivable today or that are unlikely to
have material commercial impact by 2050. The library is extensive, but not exhaustive—for
instance, our research utilized publicly available data, but there are many applications
being developed in private labs or in the defense industry where confidentiality reigns.
We estimated the direct impact by sizing four value gain drivers: reduced disease burden;

                                      improved quality; cost productivity; and environmental benefit. These estimates of potential
                                      value did not include knock-on effects. Using expert input and historical analogs, we then
                                      extrapolated our assessed impact to different time horizons by estimating the level and pace
                                      of adoption, as discussed below.19

                                      Over the next ten to 20 years, we estimate that these applications alone could have direct
                                      economic impact of between $2 trillion and $4 trillion globally per year (Exhibit E4). Whether
                                      the impact is toward the bottom or top of that range will depend on how and when innovations
                                      are adopted. As we discuss below, significant uncertainty surrounds both scientific feasibility
                                      and commercial availability. The potential could be significantly higher if downstream and
                                      secondary effects are taken into account, as discussed in the next section.

                                      Human health and performance have the most scientific advances and the clearest pipeline
                                      from research to application. The science is advanced, and the market is generally accepting
                                      of innovations. However, based on our use cases, the impact could be more broad-based;
                                      in the next ten to 20 years, more than half of the direct impact is likely to be outside health,
                                      primarily in agriculture and consumer products (Exhibit E5).

Exhibit E4

In ten to 20 years, a visible pipeline of biological applications could create approximately
$2 trillion to $4 trillion of direct annual economic impact.

                                      The Bio Revolution: Innovations transforming economies, societies, and our lives                             9


     Our library of use cases suggests that most value in the next one to two decades will come
     in four domains, or clusters of sectors where applications are emerging from bio innovation.
     Here we summarize use cases in each of these key domains (for a detailed snapshot, see
     illustration, “Applying the Bio Revolution for broad impact”).20

     — Human health and performance. A new wave of innovation is under way that includes
       cell, gene, RNA, and microbiome therapies to treat or prevent disease, innovations in
       reproductive medicine such as carrier screening, and improvements to drug development
       and delivery.21 Many more options are being explored and becoming available to treat
       monogenic (caused by mutations in a single gene) diseases such as sickle cell anemia,
       polygenic diseases (caused by multiple genes) such as cardiovascular disease, and
       infectious diseases such as malaria.22 We estimate between 1 and 3 percent of the total
       global burden of disease could be reduced in the next ten to 20 years from these
       applications—roughly the equivalent of eliminating the global disease burden of lung
       cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer combined. Over time, if the full potential is
       captured, 45 percent of the global disease burden could be addressed using science
       that is conceivable today. The direct annual global potential impact in this domain is
       estimated at $500 billion to $1.3 trillion over the next ten to 20 years, or 35 percent
       of the overall impact that we estimate for this period. The main capabilities enabling
       impact are the increased precision and personalization in the delivery of treatment and
       the accelerated pace and scope of R&D. In the longer term, innovations are likely to spread
       to more therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

     — Agriculture, aquaculture, and food. Applications such as low-cost, high-throughput
       microarrays have vastly increased the amount of plant and animal sequencing data,
       enabling lower-cost artificial selection of desirable traits based on genetic markers in
       both plants and animals.23 This is known as marker-assisted breeding and is many times
       quicker than traditional selective breeding methods.24 In addition, in the 1990s, genetic
       engineering emerged commercially to improve the traits of plants (such as yields and
       input productivity) beyond traditional breeding.25 Historically, the first wave of genetically
       engineered crops has been referred to as genetically modified organisms (GMOs);
       these are organisms with foreign (transgenic) genetic material introduced.26 Now, recent
       advances in genetic engineering (such as the emergence of CRISPR) have enabled
       highly specific cisgenic changes (using genes from sexually compatible plants) and
       intragenic changes (altering gene combinations and regulatory sequencings belonging
       to the recipient plant).27 Other innovations in this domain include using the microbiome
       of plants, soil, animals, and water to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural
       production; and the development of alternative proteins, including lab-grown meat, which
       could take pressure off the environment from traditional livestock and seafood. Direct
       annual impact from all applications in this domain could be between about $800 billion
       and $1.2 trillion over the next ten to 20 years, or 36 percent of the total.

     21
          Carrier screening is a genetic test used to determine if a healthy person is a carrier of a recessive genetic disease. It
          provides life-lasting information about an individual’s reproductive risk and their chances of having a child with a genetic
          disease.
     22
          Polygenic diseases are caused by more than one gene. Examples of polygenic conditions include hypertension, diabetes,
          and coronary heart disease. There are often many environmental factors, too, making it more difficult to discern to what
          degree a disease is genetic even when the multiple genes are identified.
     23
          A microarray is a high-throughput screening method where the DNA sequences representing the large number of genes
          of an organism, arranged in a grid pattern for detection in genetic testing.
     24
          Marker-assisted breeding uses DNA markers associated with desirable traits to enable breeders to select a trait of
          interest without using transgenic approaches. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding doesn’t produce genetically
          engineered organisms.

          A GMO is an organism whose genetic material has been altered or modified. In GM crops, DNA from foreign organisms
          such as bacteria are introduced. See Kaare M. Nielsen, “Transgenic organisms—time for conceptual diversification?,”

— Consumer products and services. Opportunities are opening up to use increasing
  volumes of biological data to offer consumers personalized products and services based
  on their biological makeup. Applications include direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic
  testing, beauty and personal care based on microbiomes, and innovative approaches
  to wellness and fitness in both humans and pets. Some of these applications could have
  indirect impact on human health, such as wellness or fitness applications.28 Annual direct
  economic impact over the next ten to 20 years in this domain could be $200 billion
  to $800 billion, or 19 percent of the total. Roughly two-thirds of this may come from
  the capability to personalize.

— Materials, chemicals, and energy. New biological ways of making and processing
  materials, chemicals, and energy could transform many industries and our daily lives,
  although the economics are challenging. Improved fermentation processes can increase
  the speed of production or quality of materials that are already created using fermentation
  (such as food and feed ingredients). Further, the creation of new bioroutes can enable
  the manufacture of more materials and chemicals biologically and the production of
  completely novel materials. Finally, advances are being made in energy, with greater use of
  biofuels, improving energy extraction, and improving energy storage. Applications include
  innovations related to production of materials such as improved fermentation processes,
  new bioroutes utilizing the ability to edit the DNA of microbes to develop novel materials
  with entirely new properties (self-repairing fabrics are one example), and building on
  advances in biofuels to innovate new forms of energy storage. Over the next ten to
  20 years, the direct annual global impact could be $200 billion to $300 billion a year, or
  8 percent of the total. This is a conservative estimate given uncertainty about what novel
  materials may emerge and the historical challenges of scaling innovations in this domain.
  About three-quarters of this economic potential is related to improved resource efficiency
  from new methods of production.

Biology has many other potential applications, although some of these are likely to be further
in the future. It could be deployed to help the environment through biosequestration—
using biological processes to capture carbon emissions from the atmosphere—and
bioremediation, which is a process to remove inorganic and organic compounds from soil,
water, and the atmosphere that might be harmful. Other potential applications could be
found in education, defense, and even space exploration. While we expect biomolecules
and biosystems innovations will drive the largest direct impact across the range of domains,
impact is also emerging in biomachine interfaces and biocomputing, where the science and
development are at an early stage but applications are promising. Applications that have
already been developed include neuroprosthetics to restore hearing and vision.




28
     We include wellness, nutrition, and fitness in consumer products and services rather than health because they tend
     to be consumed directly by individuals rather than mediated by healthcare professionals, offer more consumer choice
     compared to traditional health applications, and in some cases, such as fitness, require a significant change in consumer
     behavior to realize positive impact. This domain also includes beauty/enhancement use cases.

     The total economic impact will likely be larger than the direct impact of
     the use cases we have identified and assessed
     The direct potential impact estimated across the domains may be only a small portion of
     the potential scale of impact. Even in the near term, the impact could be larger, as new
     scientific breakthroughs emerge and as the direct impact we note above starts to have
     knock-on effects or spills over to other sectors. More broadly, the impact could radiate out
     to almost every sector of the economy, with effects on society and the environment. For
     instance, the visible pipeline of applications we sized in the human health domain is just
     a fraction of the full potential: as noted, between 1 and 3 percent of the current total global
     burden of disease could be reduced in the next ten to 20 years from just the use cases we
     examined—roughly the size of eliminating the global disease burden of lung cancer, breast
     cancer, and prostate cancer combined. While this near-term impact is rather significant, it
     is only a fraction of the transformational change that may be achievable. Many factors will
     shape the full extent of impact and the ability to capture as much of the full potential as
     possible; they include funding for basic science and treatments that pass clinical trials and are
     commercially viable alternatives to existing therapies.

     The total economic impact could be larger than our direct sizing for a number of reasons:

     — Unassessed use cases. Our library of about 400 use cases, while extensive, is not
       exhaustive. We acknowledge that there are many use cases being developed in private
       labs or in the defense industry, where developments remain confidential for commercial or
       national security reasons.

     — Faster and higher adoption. Several factors could accelerate adoption of scientific
       advances. Companies could help speed up time to market and adoption of some
       applications by working with the scientific community, for example focusing on scientific
       advances and technologies that are likely to have the most impact, investing in them,
       and partnering with innovative startups. In addition to adoption speed, adoption peaks
       could be higher due to factors such as shifting product features, customer preferences,
       and lower prices. One example of this potential is higher or faster adoption of currently
       expensive therapies (for instance, CAR T‑cell therapy for cancer) due to broader insurance
       coverage or lower prices.29

     — Knock-on economic effects. The impact of some applications could in turn have knock-
       on effects for the broader economy. For example, improved health could mean that people
       lead longer and more productive lives; this in turn means that retirement ages may rise,
       demand for eldercare delivered in the home may rise, and social security and pensions
       may need to adapt. Alternative proteins are another example: if they replace some meat
       production, land now dedicated to grazing could be repurposed for conservation efforts
       or new commercial uses.

     — Impacts on upstream, downstream, and ancillary players. After a first wave of change
       in the domains directly affected by bio innovations, a second wave may spill over to
       adjacent sectors or firms, transforming value chains and encouraging new business
       models and players. For example, applications in agriculture, aquaculture, and food could
       affect food retailing. Numerous fast-food chains have announced deals with plant-based
       meat-substitute producers to offer vegetarian and vegan versions of popular menu items.
       Logistics and transportation players may adapt to genetically engineered produce being
       able to be kept fresh for far longer even without being refrigerated, and to increased
       demand for alternative proteins.




     29
          CAR T‑cell (chimeric antigen receptor T‑cell). CAR T‑cells are genetically engineered T‑cells that express artificial
          chimeric antigen receptors on their surface. These engineered T‑cells enable a patient’s own immune system to identify
          and destroy targeted cells.

— Existing scientific breakthroughs spur more breakthroughs. Some innovations have
  the ability to generate more breakthroughs, by helping to improve existing products and
  processes or by inventing and implementing new ones. For example, the Human Genome
  Project initially set out to determine a map of the human genome. In doing so, the project
  was instrumental in pushing the development of high-throughput technologies for
  preparing, mapping, and sequencing DNA. The improved ability to sequence DNA has,
  in turn, led to sequencing of the genomes of microbes, plants, and animals, which has
  advanced many fields of science, including microbiology, virology, infectious disease, and
  plant biology. In addition, new biology and new technologies brought about by the Human
  Genome Project have enabled many other large-scale research initiatives to go forward.
  Examples include the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements research consortium (ENCODE),
  International HapMap Project, 1000 Genomes, Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, Human
  Microbiome Project, and Roadmap Epigenomics Project. 30

— More scientific breakthroughs enabling more commercial applications. Biology
  research is continually developing, and scientific breakthroughs we haven’t yet
  contemplated could provide a foundation for downstream commercial applications that
  may become available in the next few decades. For example, before the Human Genome
  Project, researchers knew the genetic basis of tens of disorders. Today, they know
  the basis of thousands of conditions. Genomics is thus helping transform medicine. More
  than 100 different drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are
  now packaged with instructions that tell doctors to test their patients for genetic variants
  linked to efficacy, dosages, or risky side effects. 31 Funding basic science or helping
  promising applications accelerate through research pipelines could directly influence
  the number of commercial applications in the future, beyond use cases we may have
  missed in our sizing.

In the longer term, every sector may be affected as bio innovation transforms profit pools,
value chains, and business models. In the years ahead, if you are not using biology to make
products, you will very likely be consuming products made that way. The impact could go
much further, with biology potentially being used to address some of the great challenges of
our time.

As an example, climate change is a key area in which biology could play a role. By 2040
to 2050, the direct applications we sized could reduce annual average man-made GHG
emissions by 7 to 9 percent from 2018 emissions levels. This is the equivalent of up to
eight times the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the global airline industry in 2018. 32
Applications such as a shift toward bioroutes for production and alternative proteins would be
important contributors to reduced emissions. The knock-on effects could alleviate pressure
on cropland and reduce deforestation.

     Total GHG emissions, including from land use, land-use change, and forestry, were 75.9 GtCO 2e in 2018, according
     to the UN’s Emissions gap report 2019. For the purposes of policy discussion and target setting, greenhouse gases
     are generally quantified by global warming potential (GWP), a measure of how much energy the emissions of one ton
     of gas will absorb during a given period, relative to the emissions of one ton of carbon dioxide. GWP is calculated for
     a specific time span, most commonly 100 years. But the lifetime for each greenhouse gas is different. Methane lasts
     in the atmosphere only for approximately 12 years, so its GWP will differ depending on a given time span. One ton of
     methane has 28 times the effect of one ton of carbon dioxide when measured at a 100-year GWP but 84 times the
     effect at a 20-year GWP. Given the importance of action and the short-term potential gain of reducing agriculture’s
     methane emissions, our primary analysis is based on 20-year GWP values. The global CO2 emissions of the airline
     industry were about 0.9 gigaton in 2018. ICAO global environmental trends – present and future aircraft noise and

     Biology could also make a significant contribution to efforts to increase food security around
     the world, addressing hunger and malnutrition. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, for
     example, suggests that by using improved fertilizer and more productive crops such as
     genetically engineered varieties, African farmers could theoretically double their yields. 33

     However, for all this potential, biological applications will not likely be a panacea for societal
     ills and challenges. In many ways, their societal effects proceed unevenly, in part driven by
     level of access to these innovations across socioeconomic groups or nations. And, critically,
     the risks of biology will need to be addressed and satisfactorily mitigated if biology is to realize
     its potential.


     Bio innovation carries profound and unique risks and issues
     Profound risks accompany this surge of innovation in biology. Get it right and the benefits
     could be significant; get it wrong and disastrous consequences could ensue at the population
     level. These risks introduce a unique set of considerations which, if not managed properly,
     could potentially outweigh the promised benefits:

     — Biology is self-replicating, is self-sustaining, and does not respect jurisdictional
       boundaries. For example, new genetically engineered gene drives applied to the vectors
       that spread disease (mosquitoes in the case of malaria) could have enormous health
       benefits, but they can be difficult to control and can potentially do permanent damage to
       ecosystems. There are also no boundaries for the spread of unintended consequences.

     — The interconnected nature of biology can increase the potential for unintended
       consequences. Biology is highly interconnected; changes to one part of a system can
       have cascading effects and unintended consequences across entire ecosystems or
       species. Examples include planting a genetically engineered crop that could result in
       unintended effects on the species or broader ecosystem. Gene editing could also have
       unintended or “off target” effects. For instance, even in successful gene editing, “off-
       target” mutations beyond those intended have been observed for all classes of genome
       editing tools used to date, including CRISPR. 34

     — Low barriers to entry open the door to potential misuse with potentially fatal
       consequences. Unlike nuclear materials, some biological technologies are relatively
       cheap and accessible. A thriving community of “biohackers” practices gene editing today
       in community labs or even at home. Commercial kits to perform CRISPR gene editing
       are sold on the internet. This activity might affect only the individuals biohacking their
       own bodies, but there are broader risks, for example if individuals are able to create
       and unleash a virus. Beyond such risks, we could see increased competition between
       companies, particularly in consumer applications, which could lead to overhyped
       marketing. Competition to bring biologically based products and services to market in
       some cases has led to commercialization before the relevant science is fully tested and
       established, which could mislead consumers, erode trust, or even compromise health
       and safety.

     — Differing value systems make it hard to forge consensus, including on life-and-
       death issues. At the heart of many of these risks is the challenge of coordination across
       value systems—at the individual, cultural, and national levels. Technical and scientific
       issues, such as embryo editing, quickly become moral questions, and often, decisions
       are expressions of one’s value system. Beyond the many risks are significant ethical
       questions that exceed the scope of this report. Is the ability to edit out disabilities before

     birth “playing God”? Is it acceptable to edit an embryo to prevent sickle cell anemia,
     but wrong to choose a baby’s skin or eye color? Sustained efforts and new approaches
     to engagement, oversight, regulation, and safeguarding are needed to manage such
     risks. These will need to take into account societal norms and acceptance that are often
     shaped by religious, cultural, and historical values and can vary widely between countries.
     The challenge of cooperation and coordination of value systems across cultures and
     jurisdictions is no easy task, particularly when advances in these scientific domains could
     be seen as a unique competitive advantage for businesses or economies.

— Privacy and consent issues are fundamental. Concerns about personal privacy and
  consent are rife, given that the cornerstone of biological advances is data mined from
  our bodies and brains. In the United States, using the results of only 1.28 million DTC
  genetic tests, it was possible to access material from open databases and identify
  about 60 percent of Americans with European ancestry from a DNA sample as of late
  2018, prompting some DTC companies to tighten up the availability of such data. 35 As
  applications of biomachine interfaces and, in particular, brain-machine interfaces spread,
  the amount of data harvested from brains will most likely increase. When and how do
  individuals give consent to what data are gathered and how they are used? Is the science
  available that can differentiate between thoughts that an individual wants and does not
  want to share?

— Unequal access could perpetuate socioeconomic disparity, with potentially
  regressive effects. Biological advances and their commercial applications may not be
  accessible to all in equal measure, thereby exacerbating socioeconomic disparity. At
  the country level, developments are advancing quickest and most broadly in relatively rich
  nations. Our analysis finds that countries with high rankings on the Institute for Health
  Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME) socio-demographic index account for roughly 30 percent
  of today’s global disease burden but could gain about 70 percent of the total share of
  reduction in the global disease burden from bio innovations. 36 Within countries, access to
  some beneficial biological applications may be cost prohibitive and thus available only to
  the wealthy, like cellular and gene therapies today. Furthermore, the very nature of these
  applications to edit “less desirable” traits could lead to outcomes that are regressive
  and disenfranchise marginalized groups. Examples of this could include genome editing
  for traits related to blindness or dwarfism, which are tied to the ongoing discussion of
  so-called ableism—that is, whether the aim of restoring a sense inherently marginalizes
  communities that do not see the lack of that sense as a disability.

These risks demand a considered response and potentially new approaches. In past waves
of technological change, regulation has emerged in response to innovations; in biology, there
is a strong argument for a proactive approach. As far back as 1975, prominent scientists,
lawyers, and medics gathered in California to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure
the safety of recombinant DNA technology. 37 The scientific communities in other fields, such
as nuclear physics and AI, are also grappling with analogous issues, and there could be room
for cross-disciplinary collaboration. Regulation will be important, but so too will oversight and
monitoring of science even as it develops, as well as safeguards that scientists build into new
biological technologies.

     National responses will not be sufficient, because biology doesn’t respect borders—as
     the world experienced firsthand with the rapid spread of the COVID‑19 infection around
     the globe. Moreover, we can already see very different regulatory responses reflecting a world
     with many different value systems. Some countries take a cautious view of frontier innovation,
     including embryo editing and genetic engineering of food crops; others take a permissive
     view. Lighter-touch regulation may deliver—or be seen to deliver—competitive advantage
     compared with a more restrictive approach. Global cooperation and coordination could help
     level the playing field but will be difficult to achieve when disparate value systems exist.


     Science is the starting point—applications need to be commercialized and
     diffused responsibly to deliver beneficial impact at scale
     The journey from the lab to adoption has three broad stages—scientific research,
     commercialization, and diffusion—that bleed into each other in a continuous evolution. For
     biological applications to diffuse and deliver beneficial impact responsibly and at scale,
     six factors are relevant that determine whether adoption occurs and how long that takes.
     The first— investing in scientific research—is germane in the first stage. Four factors—
     value propositions, business models, go to market, and operational scalability—are key for
     the second and third stages, commercialization and diffusion. The sixth relates to risk and
     mechanisms for governing the use of applications; this is vital in all three stages:

     — Investment in scientific research. Funding, tools, talent, and access to data are
       necessary and powerful elements of the investment needed to enable scientists to be
       successful. It tends to take years of research and sizable investment in these capabilities
       to get an idea to the point at which a product or service is scientifically feasible. 38 To give
       an idea of the financial investment needed, the Human Genome Project involved $3 billion
       in investment. Applications are moving along fastest in higher-income economies
       where investment money is available. The development of new tools and technologies in
       biological sciences has extended the capabilities of research. For instance, CRISPR was
       a major leap forward in the ability to edit genes. Expanding and ever-cheaper computing
       power has enabled the rapid development of bioinformatics. 39 Ensuring that sufficient
       numbers of skilled scientists are trained is vital. Finally, investment to ensure that
       scientists have access to the data on which advances depend is crucial. The development
       of annotated and accessible databases such as the Human Genome Project, GenBank,
       and UniProt has played a significant enabling role in biological advances.

     — Four factors play a role in commercialization and diffusion. Once an application is
       scientifically feasible, other factors will determine the journey from lab to market to wide
       adoption and diffusion. We have identified four key factors, the first of which is whether
       a new biology-based product or service offers a value proposition to potential end users.
       Innovations need to compete with existing products not only on cost but also by offering
       higher quality or new properties or, indeed, by meeting a need not fulfilled by existing
       offerings. Creating a value proposition is not easy. Many potential buyers of biology-
       based products are in industries with low margins such as energy and agriculture, and
       established products or methods of production have had years to develop ways to improve
       efficiency. Even when they start diffusing, some biology-based innovations remain costly.
       Although the cost is now falling rapidly, the cost to produce the first lab-grown hamburger
       was more than $300,000. 40

          We define scientific feasibility as experimental success in the target population (for instance, in the case of human health,
          success in humans rather than mice models). For applications where we could not identify proof of concept in academia
          or industry, we assessed feasibility using sector-specific analogs and expert interviews that estimate how far away
          scientific feasibility might be.

          This is a hybrid science that links biological data with techniques for information storage, distribution, and analysis to
          support multiple areas of research, including biomedicine.

— The second factor is whether business models are suitable in what may be a fast-
  changing landscape, as in most waves of innovation. New models, such as bionative
  companies that combine expertise in biology, chemistry, data science, and automation,
  may be needed. The third factor is ensuring that a new product or service effectively hits
  the right potential customers, with go-to-market elements, including pricing, sales, and
  marketing. A fourth vital factor is the ability to scale up operations; necessary aspects
  include having the right infrastructure, processes, supply chain, and talent. New bio-
  based fermentation techniques can build on considerable existing fermentation capacity,
  but more will be needed. Healthcare capacity will need to adapt and grow to disseminate
  medical innovations. For instance, with CAR T‑cells now being administered to a growing
  number of patients in hospitals and treatment centers, sufficient infrastructure for
  manufacturing and delivering the cells is necessary. 41 Again, sufficient talent is needed.
  Genetic counselors to help patients and the public understand and interpret the results
  of genetic tests are already in short supply. 42 In the United States, for instance, there were
  approximately 5,000 certified genetic counselors in 2019. 43 Yet 26 million consumers have
  taken an at-home genetic test.

— Risk and mechanisms governing use. Given the profound and unique risks
  accompanying bio innovation, mechanisms governing use, including broad acceptance
  from society and regulation, are key both in the first stage and also as the science
  commercializes and diffuses. Even if an application is scientifically feasible and
  the economics are favorable, end users and other stakeholders must want to use
  it, sometimes accepting some risk. As an illustration, it took nearly 20 years from
  the production of the first strain of Golden Rice—fortified with vitamin A—to be
  approved for use in 2019 in the Philippines, the first country with many people suffering
  from vitamin A deficiency to approve Golden Rice. 44 Regulators delayed in the face of
  persistent opposition to GMOs. 45 Our research finds that about 70 percent of the total
  potential impact could hinge on consumer, societal, and regulatory acceptance, based on
  an analysis of areas where regulations exist today in major economies. 46


The pace and extent of adoption of bio innovations vary significantly
depending on the application
The pace and extent of adoption will vary enormously depending on the application and
the domain (Exhibit E6). Some applications, including using new bioroutes to manufacture
drugs, are already showing robust signs of early commercial adoption. Others such as CAR
T‑cell therapy for cancer have recently become commercially viable at the time of writing
in 2020, meaning adoption is at an early stage and could increase rapidly over the coming
decade. Still others, such as using genetically engineered plants to sequester CO2, show
promise in scientific research, but commercial viability and adoption by farmers or other
buyers are likely further out.

     Prior to approval in Philippines, Golden Rice was registered as safe in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United

Innovators, businesses, governments, and individuals need to strike a
balance that enables potential to be captured while managing risks
Innovators, businesses, governments, and individuals need to become literate in biology,
cognizant of the benefits of innovations as well as their risks, and how to strike the right
balance between the two. The choices made today, and in the years ahead, will influence not
only the path of biological science, but also the size and scope of its benefits for economies,
societies, and the planet.

— Innovators. The scientists and researchers pioneering biological breakthroughs,
  and the developers and innovators who turn feasible science into commercially viable
  products, need to consider the opportunities and risks associated with their work. Peer
  review is a powerful internal governing mechanism to ensure that research is accurate
  and well grounded, but scientists cannot operate in a vacuum. Rather, they need to play
  a consistent and effective oversight role. They have a long track record of doing so. In
  1975, prominent scientists, lawyers, and medical professionals gathered at the Asilomar
  Conference in California to draw up voluntary guidelines to ensure the safety of
  recombinant DNA technology, for instance. 47

— Businesses. Businesses should consider how to take advantage of bio innovation,
  including adapting strategies. Companies operating in virtually every sector of
  the economy could be affected by bio innovations as applications in one domain have
  knock-on effects on upstream, downstream and adjacent sectors. In the case of
  applications in agriculture, aquaculture, and food, there will be spillover into food retailing
  and transportation, for instance. Moreover, entire value chains could be transformed. In
  the case of materials, for instance, with a shift from plastic to bio-based plastic packaging
  increasingly desired by consumers, the packaging industry could look very different.
  The meat value chain is another case in point. In the traditional meat production value
  chain, animals are bred, fed, slaughtered (fished), and processed prior to distribution, while
  the value chain for cultured meat is highly compressed, involving only tissue sampling,
  media production, and live-tissue cultivation of cells into meat—often done by the same
  company (Exhibit E7). 48

     Many companies will likely need to adapt their business strategies. Given the uncertainty
     and evidently varied timing of adoption for different applications, companies should
     consider a portfolio-based approach toward investments in bio innovation that embraces
     applications that could become commercially viable in the relatively short term, and
     those that could deliver impact further out. By its nature, bio innovation is cross-
     discipline—embracing not only biological science, but also computing, AI, data analytics,
     and engineering. As such, it is unlikely that any business existing today can go it alone.
     Therefore, it’s important to master the confluence of disciplines in bio innovation with
     the right mix of talent and collaborations. Although large companies could develop the full
     range of necessary capabilities in-house, it is likely to be quicker and more effective
     to “buy in” what they need through mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships. Small
     companies specializing in particular scientific fields are already collaborating with large
     incumbents with the market clout to commercialize at scale. As in the Digital Revolution,
     companies interested in the opportunity of bio innovation should consider platform-based
     business models that can seize cross-sector opportunities, reduce marginal costs, and
     drive combinatorial innovation by leveraging growing biological data. There are already
     platforms that offer farm-management systems and cloud-based platforms that analyze
     huge amounts of genomic data to inform breeding decisions. 49 Among other aspects



47
     Recombinant DNA molecules are formed by combining genetic material from multiple sources to create sequences
     not found in the genome (molecular cloning, for instance). See Paul Berg et al., “Summary statement of the Asilomar
     Conference on recombinant DNA molecules,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, June 1975, Volume 72,
     Number 6.

                                             to consider are the range of opportunities for more personalized and precise offerings
                                             enabled by growing amounts of biological data, and innovative revenue models that
                                             could help accelerate diffusion. Subscription-based offerings to generate revenue are
                                             becoming more common in personalized products and services based on genome and

                                      — Civil society, governments, and policy makers need to inform themselves about
                                        biological advances and to provide thoughtful guidance. Several governments,
                                        including those of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, published strategic
                                        plans and goals intended to catalyze innovation and capture its benefits. However,
                                        innovation needs to be balanced by mechanisms to govern use and misuse; whether
                                        existing professional and regulatory mechanisms are fit for purpose must be considered.

      70 percent over the next two decades. 50 Effective mechanisms to govern use, such as
      societal norms or regulations, will be needed to persuade society that innovations that
      bring benefits but may be risky and cause discomfort are being pursued safely. Today,
      policies to govern use vary significantly among countries with different value systems.
      Cross-jurisdictional cooperation is not extensive, as observed in the largely national (and
      subnational) responses in spring 2020 to the COVID‑19 pandemic.

— Individuals and consumers may be pivotal to the adoption path of biological
  advances. As observed, individual attitudes toward different types of bio innovation can
  shape the public dialogue, societal norms, regulation, and therefore the pace and extent
  of adoption. To contribute effectively to what can be controversial debates (consider
  embryo editing as an example), individuals need to seek to understand the benefits versus
  the risks. They also need to appreciate that there are personal trade-offs. DTC testing,
  for instance, provides individuals with potentially valuable insights into the probability of
  contracting certain diseases, but mining that information may compromise their privacy.




The current wave of innovation in biological sciences, combined with advances in data,
analytics, and digitization, has been decades in the making. It builds on 50 years or more of
scientific breakthroughs (see illustration, “A partial timeline of accelerating breakthroughs in
biological sciences”). The Bio Revolution goes far beyond treating disease and into virtually
every sector of the economy. Scientists in conjunction with forward-thinking companies
are now harnessing the power of nature to solve pressing problems in medicine and
agriculture, and, in some areas, forging innovative solutions that could mitigate pressure on
the environment and help tackle climate change. The serious, and potentially irreversible,
risks inherent in biology need to be fully acknowledged and directly addressed. The choices
stakeholders make today and in the years ahead will determine whether what is shaping up as
a Bio Revolution delivers on its considerable promise—and in a way that is safe and equitable
for humanity and sustainable for the planet.

     Analysis includes examination of existing regulations in the different countries and their applicability to sized
     applications. Applications are also considered at stake if they are related to highly sensitive topics in academic circles,
     such as embryo editing and bioweapons. Analysis of existing regulations as of September 2019.

1. A revolution in
   biological sciences
  Imagine a world in which it is possible to produce most meat synthetically without rearing
  animals, paralyzed patients can have their spinal cords restored with the help of stem cells,
  industrial chemicals are produced in factories that use microbes, diseases caused by genetics
  are prevented before birth, diets and fitness regimens tailored to individual genomes and
  microbiomes help extend life expectancy, and biomachine interfaces enable direct mental
  control of electronics. The foundational technologies for all of these possibilities are already
  in place.

  A number of advances contribute to a real sense of momentum. The Human Genome Project
  that mapped the entire human genome was an important foundational element, but its
  promise truly started to materialize as sequencing DNA became cheaper and faster. Genome
  sequencing has grown ever more precise—it is now possible to sequence single cells,
  which gives researchers and physicians the ability to assess mutations and malignancies
  at an unprecedented level of detail. 51 The CRISPR tool edits genes many times faster than
  previous techniques and with greater precision. Stem cell research is another frontier where
  there are significant advances.

  All of these innovations are evidence of a new era that integrates biology, computing, and
  engineering. Indeed, these breakthroughs come on the heels of—and owe much to—
  advances in other technologies and disciplines, including physics, chemistry, statistics, and
  more. The production of biological data has also exploded, with worldwide DNA sequencing
  alone generating massive volumes of biological data each year. 52 Declining computing costs
  have made it increasingly economically viable to store, manipulate, and interpret this data
  on a massive scale. These different types of technology are interacting powerfully with each
  other—and are all falling in cost. The boom in biological data is likely to strengthen because of
  advances in machine learning, AI, and bioinformatics.

  These technologies are interacting and reinforcing one another, and the lines between
  them are becoming blurred. Many applications of current and developing biological
  science will use more than one scientific discipline. Scientific advances under way will
  enable an unprecedented level of personalization and precision in products and services
  across sectors. The science now exists that supports tailoring products and treatments to
  an individual’s genetic predisposition, real-time molecular measurement, and even thoughts
  captured as neural signals.

  In this chapter, we describe the confluence of scientific advances underpinned by
  developments in molecular biology, computing, and data processing. Various streams of
  research are proceeding at different paces, and the time it takes for them to reach the point
  where uses can be commercialized will also differ substantially. Taken in the round, ongoing
  advances in the understanding of biology and the ability to measure, map, control, and create
  biological functions from single biomolecules to entire organisms amount to a revolution in
  biological sciences.

                                      Bio innovation is occurring in four arenas
                                      Several trends in science and technology are powering human understanding of biological
                                      processes and enabling us to engineer them for myriad uses. Innovations cover a wide range
                                      of interdisciplinary fields in four key arenas: biomolecules, biosystems, biomachine interfaces,
                                      and biocomputing. Major breakthroughs in each are reinforcing one another (Exhibit 1).
                                      The bio innovations described in this report build on an extensive foundation of pioneering
                                      research that has enabled innovation to develop in these four arenas.

Of the four, innovators are most active in the field of biomolecules, which is developing
the fastest judging by the number of active startups and amount of funding.53 Biosystems,
which is closely related to biomolecules, is the second-most-active area. 54 Biomachine
interfaces, or connecting nervous systems to machines, are at a relatively early stage, but
activity is increasing among established technology companies, academic research labs, and
emerging startups. 55 Biocomputing is arguably the least developed of the four key arenas. 56

Biomolecules
This area groups biological sciences that are collectively known as omics and molecular
technologies (see Box 1, “The full range of omics and molecular technologies”). Omics consist
primarily of mapping and measuring various molecules and pathways within cells. Molecular
technologies engineer such molecules and pathways.

Of all the omics, genomics is the most technologically advanced; applications that measure
and map genes and then engineer them are in full development and use. However,
the genome is by no means the entire story; other omics—particularly epigenomics—are
needed to understand phenotypes (characteristics that manifest) by studying a number
of steps such as what genes are expressed, at what level, and what environmental factors
have an influence. 57 While the genome is largely static, other omics are dynamic and vary
across time and in different environments. Work on these other omics is increasing. In
particular, analysis and engineering of RNA (transcriptomics) and proteins (proteomics) are
accelerating. 58 The science behind each omic varies in maturity, and accordingly, the amount
of funding and the volume of publications in each area vary widely (Exhibit 3).

57
     A phenotype is an organism’s observable characteristics that could be influenced both by the genes of the organism and
     the environment. The genotype is expressed when the information encoded in genes’ DNA is used to make protein and
     RNA molecules. The expression of the genotype contributes to the individual’s observable traits—the phenotype. An
     allele is any of the alternative forms of a gene that may occur at a given locus.
58
     Transcriptomics is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete set of RNA transcripts of a
     biological system (such as the human gut or skin, and in the soil around farms) at a specific point in time. Proteomics is the
     comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete set of proteins of a biological system (cell, tissue, organ,
     biological fluid, or organism) at a specific point in time.

     Box 1
     The full range of omics and molecular technologies

     Omics is a collective name for a number of scientific research streams that collectively map
     and measure biological molecules in a particular “ome.” In this research, we also include
     technologies for the engineering of biological molecules (Exhibit 2). The first set of omes
     corresponds to the central dogma of molecular biology in which genes are transcribed into
     RNA and then translated into proteins.

     Genomics. This is the study of genes and their functions and of techniques related to them.
     The genome consists of the full genetic complement of an organism; its DNA is composed
     of building blocks called nucleotides. Genotyping is the process of determining the genetic
     makeup of an individual by examining the DNA sequence. An organism’s genotype is the sets
     of genes it carries, while a phenotype is all of an organism’s observable characteristics,
     which are influenced both by the genotype and the environment. Genotyping (mapping and
     analyzing the genome) can be carried out in small pieces with microarrays, including single
     nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, traditional Sanger sequencing, and next-
     generation sequencing.1 Whole-genome sequencing is the analysis of the entire genomic
     DNA sequence of an organism rather than small fragments contained in an SNP. Among
     technologies being developed for engineering genes are DNA synthesis, CRISPR, TALEN,
     and zinc finger nuclease.2

     Epigenomics. This is the study of the epigenome, which is made up of all the chemical
     compounds and proteins that can attach to DNA. These chemicals (also called epigenetic
     modifications) can turn genes on or off, controlling the production of RNA and resultant
     proteins in particular cells without directly changing the DNA sequence. 3 Among mapping
     and analyzing technologies that tend to be used in epigenomics (but also in other omics) are
     ChIPseq (a method used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins across
     the genome), ATAC-seq (a technique used to assess the accessibility of genome-wide
     chromatin), and mass spectrometry. 4 CRISPR can be used to engineer the epigenome, too.
     The science in this field is exploratory.

     Transcriptomics. The transcriptome is the complete set of RNA transcripts produced at
     a given time and is highly dynamic. RNA is a polymeric molecule that is an intermediary
     between encoding DNA and resultant proteins that performs cellular functions. It is essential
     in coding, decoding, regulating, and expressing genes. Technologies include RNA-Seq, which
     uses next-generation sequencing to show the presence and quantity of RNA in a sample,
     whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and RNA microarrays. 5 Engineering technologies
     include RNA editing and RNA silencing or siRNA.6 The science in this field is exploratory.

     Proteomics. This discipline relates to the proteome, the entire set of proteins in a cell or
     organism, with changes in quantity and composition over time. These proteins influence
     almost every aspect of biology, from cell structure to metabolism, transport, and signaling
     pathways. Debate surrounds what constitutes proteomics. We define proteomics as



     1
         Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a catch-all term that refers to a range of modern high-throughput DNA sequencing
         technologies in which millions or billions of small DNA fragments can be sequenced in parallel. The sequences of these
         small fragments will be pieced together by mapping against the human reference genome.
     2
         Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) are enzymes engineered to enable targeted modification of any
         DNA sequence in a large range of organisms. Zinc finger nuclease is a class of engineered proteins that bind DNA and
         create double strand breaks at user-specified locations to facilitate targeted editing of the genome.
     3
         When epigenomic compounds attach to DNA and modify DNA function, they are said to have “marked” the genome.
         Epigenetic modifications in some cases can be inherited through the generations. Environmental influences, such as a
         person’s diet and exposure to pollutants, can also affect the epigenome.
     4
         Mass spectrometry is a tool used for measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of one or more molecules present in a sample.
         Mass spectrometers can be used to identify unknown compounds by determining their molecular weight, to quantify
         known compounds, and to determine the structure and chemical properties of molecules. They are used in epigenomics,
         proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and microbiomics.

large‑scale study of proteins rather than the study of a single protein. For this research,
traditional methods of targeting and manipulating proteins using small molecules or biologics
such as enzymes, antibodies, and hormones do not fall into our category of omics and
molecular technologies. Mapping and analyzing technologies here include de novo protein
synthesis and mass spectrometry.7 They also include SOMAmer array (a proprietary platform
of Somalogic), multiplex bead-based immunoassays (Luminex platform), ultrasensitive
protein-binding array (Quanterix platform), and protein crystallization. This is an emerging
area of research.

Metabolomics. This is the study of metabolites, which are the small-molecule intermediates
and products of metabolism. 8 We classify this research as exploratory. Mapping and analysis
tools included here are primarily mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy.9

Glycomics. This nascent field relates to the structure and function of the complete set of
glycosylated (glycosylation is the reaction in which a carbohydrate is attached to a hydroxyl or
other functional group of another molecule) products such as glycans. Mapping and analysis
technologies include mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography.10

Lipidomics. This is research into the complete range of lipids.11 The technologies are the same
as in metabolomics. This is a nascent field.

Microbiomics. This is the study of the microbiome, an area of increasing interest that we
classify as emerging. The microbiome consists of all the microbes in a population such
as the human gut or skin, and in the soil around farms. Humans are largely made up of
microbes—indeed, they outnumber human cells.12 Bacteria in the microbiome help us to
digest food, regulate our immune systems, protect against other bacteria that cause disease,
and produce vital vitamins.13 Mapping and analysis technologies here are DNA sequencing
and mass spectrometry. Engineering technologies include microbiome transplantation and
genetically engineering specific microbes to alter a microbiome.

Single-cell omics. This is an area that applies to all omics. It is the study of individual cells
in a way that captures the diversity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of single cells instead of
the average signal from a set of heterogenous cells collected in a typical sample. For example,
while performing DNA sequencing of individual cells in a tumor, it may be possible to assess
the distribution of mutations within it; some cells will have all the mutations while others will
have only some of those that led to malignancy.

Cell-free sequencing. It is possible to sequence fragments of DNA or RNA that are floating
freely in the bloodstream rather than directly sampled from the source cells. In humans, this
type of sampling is considered noninvasive compared with having to biopsy a tumor (termed
“liquid biopsy”) or the developing parts of a fetus, for example.14


7
     Mass spectrometry is well established and is widely used to analyze biological samples. As interest in our desire to

                                     The cost of mapping, sequencing, and analyzing the genome has fallen even as the speed
                                     has increased in recent years (Exhibit 4). The cost of DNA sequencing is declining at a quicker
                                     pace than Moore’s Law, which holds that the processing power of computers doubles
                                     roughly every 18 months for the same cost. The sequencing of the first human genome cost
                                     almost $3 billion. In 2019, the cost was less than $1,000.59 Within a decade, the cost could
                                     be less than $100.60 DNA testing is also increasingly sensitive, able to detect even fragments
                                     circulating in the blood. A fall in the cost of computing has enabled next-generation DNA
                                     sequencing, a range of modern techniques in which millions or billions of DNA strands can
                                     be sequenced in parallel, and then assembled into a single sequence. This assembly is
                                     needed because it is not possible to sequence a whole genome directly in one read using
                                     current sequencing technologies.61 Current so-called “Third Generation Sequencing” is

                                      In the wake of the COVID‑19 outbreak, scientists were able to sequence and publicly
                                      share the whole coronavirus genome just a few weeks after the first cases were reported
                                      in December 2019.63 By comparison, during the SARS outbreak in 2002, full genome
                                      sequencing of the virus took more than five months after the first reported case.64

                                      A similar dynamic interaction may take place between cheaper computing and the other
                                      omics as they develop. Advances in bioinformatics and AI mean that it is possible to mine
                                      much more information and insight from omic data sets. AI is enhancing these techniques.
                                      Bioinformatic techniques are needed to analyze and interpret data generated from omics, and

                                            Third-generation sequencing is defined in various ways, but is generally taken to mean technologies that can sequence

AI promises to further enhance our understanding of all omic data sets and thereby enable
a proliferation of applications. These complementary technologies have already enabled
computer-intensive research such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that find
associations between a particular human trait and variation in a genetic sequence throughout
the genome across a large population. 65 GWAS are responsible for a wave of discoveries about
the risk factors for common diseases. In a GWAS, researchers use computers to compare
genomes across large populations, including some people who have a particular disease
and many who don’t. Subject groups that are otherwise well matched in aspects such as age
and gender are sequenced to find areas of consistent differences, that is which genes are
associated with which traits. If such areas are discovered, this helps scientists to zero in on
parts of the genome that are responsible for the risk of disease.66

Genomic engineering technologies have shown exponential improvement. Technologies
in DNA synthesis are developing. Although the ability to synthesize DNA de novo is limited
in comparison with sequencing DNA, the gap is closing.67 New inkjet- and semiconductor-
based technologies have reduced costs and, at the same time, increased the accuracy of
microarray-based DNA synthesis. Synthesized DNA strands can now be longer and cheaper
than ever before. At the same time, DNA editing is advancing rapidly. It is now possible to
edit genomic sequences—program life, if you will—more efficiently and effectively through
tools such as CRISPR applied to human, plant, animal, and microbial DNA.68 Research teams
around the world developed the technology, which is within the capabilities of a basic biology
lab to use.

CRISPR is relatively precise and cost-efficient because it requires only one endonuclease
(an enzyme that breaks down a nucleotide chain into two or more shorter chains by cleaving
the phosphodiester bond within a polynucleotide chain) and a short single strand of gRNA
(guide RNA).69 The first human clinical trials of CRISPR were held in 2016 by researchers at
Sichuan University in China who injected a cancer patient with cells containing CRISPR-
edited genes.70 In 2016, 1,097 CRISPR patents were issued. By 2017, the number of CRISPR
patents had risen to 1,303. It took only two years to develop the science for CRISPR and
only one to commercialize this approach. Recent advances have made it possible to modify
multiple target sites—about 25—within genes in a cell simultaneously.71 These advances have
also set off a new generation of bioengineering research in the field of synthetic biology,
which has provided the basis for many of the technologies covered in the biomolecules area.

Mass spectrometry underlies a number of the nonnucleotide (DNA, RNA) omics, but thus far
advances have not been as rapid. Scientists face a number of challenges. More sensitivity is
needed. Today, proteins, metabolites, and lipids cannot be amplified for detection like DNA
or RNA, meaning that differences are much harder to detect. There is too much complexity
because of the heterogeneity of proteins as well as the greater number of amino acids that
make up proteins (20) compared to the nucleotides that make up nucleic acids (four). This
makes proteomics inherently more difficult than nucleotide-based omics.72 The degree of
automation is limited, and skilled technicians still have to do a considerable amount of manual

     work in preparing samples. Scalability is limited because, for instance, high-throughput
     proteomic analyses such as flow cytometry and ELISA still require antibodies.73 Overall, high-
     throughput mass spectrometry is still not cost-effective. Furthermore, the Human Proteome
     Project, launched in 2010, lacks deeply annotated reference maps like those developed as
     part of the Human Genome Project.74 Incomplete and sometimes inaccurate databases hinder
     proteomic annotation, and procedures for preparation and analysis of samples vary among
     labs and research groups. Finally, mass spectrometry tends to rest on proprietary software
     rather than the open-source software typical of genomic bioinformatics, which also slows
     the rate of progress.75

     In many cases, engineering the transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, glycome, and lipidome
     is accomplished through modified genetic sequences that express modified RNA and
     proteins to effect changes in the cell. However, some molecular technologies directly involve
     the administration or modification of RNA or proteins, some of which are synthesized de novo.

     Biosystems
     Biosystems relates to the mapping and engineering of cells, tissues, and organs, and includes
     stem cell technologies, uses for transplantation, as well as the 3-D printing of tissues.
     The science of mapping and characterizing biosystems has advanced significantly. Since
     2016, the Human Cell Atlas project has created the most comprehensive reference maps of all
     human cells in a healthy body with unprecedented detail, cell types and subtypes, numbers,
     locations, cell states, cell lineage, and molecular components. Once complete, it will be
     a fundamental resource for scientists, allowing them to better understand how healthy cells
     work as a basis for research, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. The maps are expected
     to help identify markers and signatures for different diseases and uncover new targets for
     therapeutic intervention. In addition to mapping, enormous progress also has been made on
     the engineering front. Regenerative medicine is a promising field that could lead to treatments
     that do not exist today for patients with spinal cord injuries or in need of organ transplants.76
     Progress in biosystems arises out of advances in omics and molecular technologies such as
     genetic engineering, although the engineering of tissues can also be undertaken without such
     technology. Other examples of biosystems exist in food (meat grown in labs) and materials
     (one company is making leather using mushroom cells).

     In the medical field, one of the key components of biosystems is the evolution of stem cell
     research. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when, and by whom, what we now call stem cells were
     first identified, although the consensus is that the first to define the key characteristics of
     these cells rigorously was a team in Toronto in the 1960s.77 Since then, the science and its
     application have progressed significantly. In 1998, a method to derive and maintain stem cells
     with the ability of differentiating into cells of all tissues in the body from human embryos was
     reported, intensifying the interests of using stem cells’ properties in regenerative medicine.
     Later in 2006, scientists learned how to reprogram adult cells into cells known as induced

          Flow cytometry is a laser-based technology that counts, sorts, and profiles cells or particles within a liquid suspension.
          ELISA is short for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay—it detects and measure the amount of a substance in a solution
          such as serum. This technique utilizes antibodies linked to enzymes that can produce a color change or other measurable
          effect.

pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs.78 The discovery of iPSCs was important because it uncovered
new knowledge about how differentiation works and provided an alternative to embryonic
stem cells, whose use had raised ethical issues.79 iPSCs take adult cells and apply different
molecular factors that change the cells back to undifferentiated or “blank” cells that can then
be induced to develop into other types of cells, such as spinal cord or liver cells. Adult stem
cells are usually used to repair and replace cells, for instance in bone marrow.

Research continues into how cells differentiate. Scientists have already demonstrated,
for example, that stem cells can be differentiated into cone cells, one of the two types of
photoreceptor cells in the retina that are responsible for color vision and light sensitivity;
there is the potential, therefore, to treat blindness caused by macular degeneration. 80 It is
now thought that mesenchymal stem cells found in bone marrow may be able to differentiate
into many other cell types, but no treatments using these cells have yet been clinically
proven. 81 Interest in this area is intense. In 2016, there were more than 490 clinical trials using
mesenchymal stem cells. 82

The ability to build biosystems from a single cell into tissues and even complete organs has
gradually grown closer as the cost of 3-D bioprinting falls and microfabrication technology
advances. The cost of both bioprinters and biomaterials is declining as demand rises and
novel materials are developed and become available. 83 Commercial 3-D bioprinters cost
$5,000 to $200,000, but research labs are repurposing low-cost 3-D printers such as
MakerBots to bring the price down to about $500. 84 Often the creation of complex tissues
and organs requires more than simply printing the right cells in the right shapes. Researchers
have used advances in microfluidics and biomaterials to create the scaffolds and complex
arrangements needed to mimic tissue microenvironments, moving closer to creating fully
functioning organs. 85 Further scientific advances will be needed to make the printing of fully
functioning organs a reality. 86 Pioneering scientist Jennifer Lewis at Harvard, who is working
on printing organs, says that this is decades away. 87

Biomachine interfaces
Biology and machines can now interact, creating biomachine interfaces. The technology now
exists to measure neural signals in real time and translate them into actions for a computer or
machine; it is also possible to use machines directly to influence and modify neural systems
(Exhibit 5). 88

Innovation in software and hardware has enabled this area. It is now possible to acquire
signals of neural measurements with improved temporal and spatial resolution. Sensors
can be placed on the scalp, on the exposed surface of the brain, or directly into the cortex to
measure single neuronal activity. It is increasingly possible to extract features using improved

     These are adult cells (for instance, skin cells) that are reprogrammed into an embryonic stem cell-like state that enables
     the development unlimited amounts of any type of human cells. In this process, adult cells (for instance, skin or blood
     cells) are reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state that enables the development of an unlimited
     source of any type of human cell needed for therapeutic purposes. See History of stem cell use, University of Nebraska
     Medical Center.

     Embryonic stem cells are stem cells that comprise human embryos that are three to five days old. They are pluripotent
     stem cells, meaning they can give rise to many cell populations in the body.

                                      processing algorithms to find meaningful content even within a noisy signal. Improved
                                      machine learning enables biomachine interfaces to classify features and accurately map them
                                      into interpreted categories. Classifications can then be translated to control software via
                                      a mouse or keyboard and hardware such as prosthetics.

                                      Biomachine interfaces include a range of technologies, from simple, noninvasive biofeedback
                                      devices that are already available to consumers—and could be refined and popularized
                                      in the immediate future—to speculative concepts whose commercialization and adoption
                                      remain a long way off. The latter category includes direct brain-to-brain communication and
                                      education through neural inputs.

                                      There are still issues to resolve. For instance, noninvasive techniques still lack the neuron-
                                      scale resolution needed for many applications. Implanted devices are needed for high-
                                      resolution reading, but this level of invasiveness is impeding progress. Any technology
                                      currently capable of registering neural brain activity at a resolution of less than hundreds
                                      of neurons requires implanting devices in the skull. 89 This not only raises ethical questions
                                      about using humans to test and develop this new technology, but also presents severe risks of
                                      infection or complications arising from such a profound surgical procedure.90

Biocomputing
Biocomputing includes the use of cells or molecules such as DNA or enzymes to solve
mathematical problems, a process known as biology-based parallel computing. This
area is in a relatively early phase of development but has potentially exciting applications.
Theoretically, biology-based parallel computing can perform many calculations in parallel,
with each molecule or cell performing one computation.91 For now, however, researchers have
not progressed beyond solving theoretical problems that traditional computers can easily
handle.92 A key limitation is that while computations with biological substrates can quickly be
parallelized by growing more cells or using a large quantity of molecules, substantial up-front
effort is required to engineer cells or systems to solve each problem. Therefore, there is
a trade-off between any theoretical advantages in computation time and the months of effort
it would take to build a biologic substrate-based computer.

In contrast to computation, biological data storage—using DNA as a data-storage medium—
has immediate potential to outpace electronic means of storage. Extremely stable and
information-dense, DNA can store 5.5 petabits of encoded data in one cubic millimeter, with
each bit duplicated 100 times for redundancy. Looking at this from another perspective,
it has been estimated that one kilogram of DNA could hypothetically store all current
data in the world.93 DNA is very stable, even in suboptimal conditions; it can be readable
after thousands of years.94 DNA could eventually replace magnetic tape for long-term
archival storage and arguably is the only current biocomputing technology that could rival
traditional alternatives.




Several trends in science and technology are powering human understanding of biological
processes and enabling us to engineer them for myriad uses. These technologies range from
lower-cost, more rapid gene sequencing, to the ability to program genetic sequences as if
they were computer code, to breakthroughs in neural sensing and signaling. In the following
chapter, we look at the potential practical applications of these scientific breakthroughs as
they move out of the lab and into commercial use.

2. New capabilities could
   transform economies
   and societies
  Scientific breakthroughs over the past two decades have laid the foundation for
  fundamentally new capabilities that have the potential to transform business, society, and
  the environment. They are the tools driving change. The effects will be felt across value
  chains, from how R&D is conducted to the physical inputs in manufacturing to the way
  medicines and consumer products are delivered and consumed. Two data points from our
  research give an idea of the potential scale and scope.

  First, we estimate that as much as 60 percent of the physical inputs to the global economy
  could be produced biologically. Our analysis suggests that around one-third of these inputs
  are biological materials, such as wood, cotton, and animals bred for food. For these materials,
  innovations can, in principle, improve upon existing production processes. For instance,
  squalene, a moisturizer used in skin-care products, is traditionally derived from shark liver oil
  and can now be produced more sustainably through fermentation of genetically engineered
  yeast. The remaining two-thirds are not biological materials—examples include plastics and
  aviation fuels. These could, in principle, be produced using innovative biological processes or
  could be replaced with substitutes using bio innovations. For example, nylon is already being
  made using genetically engineered microorganisms instead of petrochemicals. To be clear,
  the full potential is a long way off, but even modest progress toward it could transform supply
  and demand and economics of, and participants in, the provision of physical inputs. Biology
  has the potential in the future to determine what we eat, what we wear, the products we put on
  our skin, and the way we build our physical world.

  Second, as we discuss in more detail in later chapters, biological sciences could play a major
  role in reducing the current global disease burden. Still, the timing and adoption of these
  capabilities will vary. In this chapter, we identify some of the most important capabilities.


  New capabilities are being created that provide the building blocks of
  profound change in economies and societies
  In this section, we highlight five areas where the new capabilities could be deployed and,
  where measurable, the scale of their potential impact.

  Biological means could be used to produce a large share of the global economy’s
  physical materials, potentially with improved performance and sustainability
  Materials have played such a fundamental role in human history that historians have named
  entire time periods after them—the Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages. Each step forward in
  the evolution of materials has heralded a paradigm shift in technology, society, and quality
  of life.

  Now is the era of biology, which is increasingly being used to create novel materials that
  can raise quality, introduce entirely new capabilities, and offer more environmentally
  sustainable profiles.

  Fermentation, for centuries used to make bread and brew beer, is now being used to create
  fabrics such as artificial spider silk. Leather is being made from mushroom roots instead

     of animal hide.95 US startup Tandem Repeat produces self-repairing, biodegradable, and
     recyclable fabric by isolating genes from squid that have the ability to synthesize self-
     healing fibers, and then producing fabrics through fermentation.96 The fabric also minimizes
     microfiber shedding during washing, thereby reducing the flow of microplastics into
     the oceans. Meanwhile, biotech company Zymergen is creating renewable biomaterials for
     optical films used in displays, flexible electronics circuits, and hard, scratch-proof coatings.97

     Cultured meat and seafood are not yet available for consumers to buy, but they could
     become cost competitive with meat from rearing animals in the next ten years, potentially
     taking pressure off land use, helping to slow deforestation, and lowering the burden on
     oceans. Reducing the cost of cultured meat to a competitive level will be challenging, but
     some companies, including Finless Foods, Mosa Meat, Memphis Meats, and Meatables
     are now experimenting with using synthetic molecules and stem cells to replace expensive
     growth factors.98 Amyris produces a moisturizing oil, squalene, that is used in many skin-care
     products through fermentation of sugarcane via genetically engineered yeast, rather than by
     processing deep-sea-shark liver oil, which is costly and environmentally questionable. Not
     only can the company produce cost-effectively on a large scale, but it can also do so from
     a renewable source.99

     A significant share of materials developed through biological means are biodegradable and
     generate less carbon during manufacture and processing than traditional materials. New
     bioroutes are being developed to produce chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides.
     Work has already been done on new pesticides that uses gene silencing—RNA interference
     (RNAi)—that inhibits the life functions of insects; the first RNAi insecticide was approved for
     commercial use in 2017.100 Some companies are using genetically engineered microbes to
     create biofuels for the aviation and marine industries.101 One startup is using microorganisms
     to create an alternative to traditional cement that produces far less carbon emissions during
     its manufacture.102

     Increased control and precision in methodology is occurring across the value chain, from
     delivery to development and consumption with more personalization
     Advances in molecular biology have made R&D and delivery processes more precise and
     predictable. In healthcare, many medical treatments have been designed for the average
     patient, a one-size-fits-all approach that inherently means varying levels of efficacy. Using
     mounting knowledge of a person’s genetic makeup and improved understanding of the link
     between genes and certain diseases, researchers now have significant scope to tailor
     medical approaches to the individual’s genome—personalized or precision medicine.103 Ever-
     cheaper genome sequencing means that such personalization is increasingly observed in
     medical practice, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of rare disorders.104 Advances in
     precision medicine have already led to powerful new discoveries and several new treatments
     tailored to a person’s genetic makeup or the genetic profile of an individual’s tumor. Patients
     with breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanomas and leukemias, now routinely

undergo molecular testing to optimize treatments. Personalized medicine is not yet routine for
most people, but it is spreading. This will benefit healthcare outcomes.

Precision also applies to agriculture, where increasingly the insights from a plant’s or
soil’s microbiome can be used to optimize yields by enabling more targeted or economical
agricultural production.105 Personalization and precision are being applied to consumer goods
and services such as individual nutrition plans based on genetic tests.106

The capability to engineer and reprogram human and nonhuman organisms is increasing
Healthcare is a big-ticket item across the world. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), global spending on health in 2017 was $7.8 trillion, or about 10 percent of global
GDP. Between 2000 and 2017, global health spending increased by nearly 4 percent a year
in real terms against annual GDP growth of 3.0 percent.107 Of course, the cost of poor health
goes far beyond the money spent on it by health systems—for instance, it compromises
productivity and ultimately economic growth. Improving the health of populations is therefore
a major economic issue as well as a human one. Biological sciences are already helping meet
this challenge. Diagnosis of common disorders has been much faster and more accurate
over the past ten years thanks to advances in large-scale parallel DNA sequencing.108 Gene
drives could be used to prevent vector-borne diseases, including malaria, dengue fever,
schistosomiasis, and Lyme disease. Gene therapies could offer complete cures of some
diseases for the first time through the direct editing of abnormal genes in cells in individuals.
Gene therapies have been approved for beta thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy,
hemophilia, and some immune deficiencies, and trials were being conducted in 2019 for other
monogenic diseases such as sickle cell anemia.109 Such innovations could reduce healthcare
spending and, by prolonging life spans and promoting health, boost productivity and growth if
people are able to work longer if they so choose.

The same technical advances that are driving the capability to improve human health can
be used to introduce valuable new traits that, for instance, improve the output or yield of
nonhuman organisms like microbes, plants, and animals. Crops can be genetically engineered
to taste better, produce higher yields, and be more heat- or drought-resistant, for instance—
traits that could become even more important if climate change continues to increase global
temperatures.110 Microbes can be genetically engineered to produce different substances,
from cellular vaccines to industrial enzymes. In the future, pets could be engineered to shed
less hair, which may be popular with consumers. For nonhuman genetic engineering, the same
ethical red flags apply as with humans.

New methodologies using automation, machine learning, and proliferating biological
data are enhancing discovery, throughput, and productivity in R&D
In the past, scientists relied on finding random mutations to identify beneficial traits—
discovery by accident. Today, increasingly there is a rational approach to R&D based on far
greater information. And there is emerging evidence that the interaction between biology and
computing can accelerate the R&D process, which could help address R&D’s productivity
problem. McKinsey analysis in 2017 found that the ratio of revenue to R&D spending in
the biopharmaceutical industry hit a productivity nadir between 2008 and 2011.111 The average

     cost of bringing a drug to market has been estimated at $2.6 billion, or 140 percent higher
     than a decade ago.112 Genomics could be deployed to reduce the development costs of a new
     drug by nearly 50 percent.113 Biotech companies and research institutes are increasingly
     using robotic automation and sensors in labs to accelerate speed and accuracy compared
     with traditional labs that tend to rely on human scientists conducting experiments manually.114
     Research from one biotech company concludes that throughput can increase up to ten times
     compared with traditional corporate or academic labs, significantly increasing the probability
     of scientific breakthroughs, significantly accelerating cycle times, and potentially reducing
     costs.115 Advanced analytics using machine learning can lead to better insights during the R&D
     process, and more systematic links between health data and diseases can help scientists and
     health practitioners to arrive more quickly at optimal treatments.

     Potential is growing for interfaces between biological systems and computers
     Humankind increasingly works in tandem with machines—our workplaces are more
     automated, and we are ever more reliant on our smartphones. But a more intimate relationship
     is developing, enabled by sophisticated algorithms and systems, in which machines are able
     to use signals from the brain and even send signals back, advancing or restoring human
     capabilities. One prominent type of biomachine interface is the neuroprosthetic that restores
     lost sensory functions by delivering stimulation to the brain based on light or sound; other
     neuroprosthetics are able to record and interpret signals from the brain to control physical
     movement of a prosthetic limb with increasing exactitude. There have been large strides
     in bionic vision over the past two decades. Approved in the EU and the United States,
     SecondSight’s retinal implant has enabled clinically blind patients to distinguish shapes,
     sense light, and even read print.116 Much progress is being made in treatments and diagnostic
     technology that stimulate the brain or interpret its signals. Deep brain stimulation (DBS),
     a procedure in which a stimulator in the patient’s chest is connected via electrodes to parts
     of the brain, was approved for the treatment of epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease some
     years ago. Now research is under way into whether DBS could help patients suffering from
     Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anxiety.117

     Just as digital technologies are able to enhance biological systems, in the case of biomachine
     interfaces, the relationship can also work the other way around: biology may be a solution
     to some established challenges of the digital world. Consider, for instance, the headache
     of storing data. Every day, an estimated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is generated globally.118
     The world could run out of silicon to store data by 2040.119 But biology offers a solution in DNA
     data storage. DNA is about one million times denser than hard-disk storage; one kilogram of
     DNA could hypothetically store all current data in the world.120 DNA doesn’t deteriorate and
     could therefore store data for hundreds or even thousands of years. Work is already under
     way exploring this area.

The potential impact of these capabilities on economies and societies
could be broad in both scope and scale
These emerging capabilities could touch multiple domains in the economy, both directly
and indirectly. Applications may change everything from the food we consume to textiles to
the types of health treatments we receive and how we build our physical world. The potential
value is substantial. For instance, at least 45 percent of the global disease burden could be
addressed from what is scientifically conceivable today. Bio innovations could transform
the way we prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases.

These innovations will also transform research and development—and indeed have already
begun to do so, through high-throughput screening, CRISPR, and machine learning that
leverages biological data. We estimate that roughly 30 percent of private-sector R&D in
major economies is in industries where biological data, biological inputs, or biological means
of production could be used.121 The power of these biological technologies, their effects on
production and markets, and broader societal influence suggest that the advances in biology
could even rival other periods of scientific and technological ferment, such as the Industrial
Revolution and the mass adoption of digital technologies in recent years, as discussed in
the next section.

Some of the potential applications we identify are still at an early stage, and many others
may surface in coming years. The full impact of the value of biological applications remains
in the future, but already, it is possible to identify some key applications and domains where
these technologies could be deployed. Over the past five to ten years, proof-of-concept
experimentation has increasingly emerged from the lab and into the marketplace. Many
applications, particularly in health and agriculture, are now in the commercialization phase.
Products from materials to chemicals are being replaced by alternatives produced and
processed using biological means that are often more efficient and, in many cases, put less
pressure on the environment. While the early direct impacts of biological technologies are for
now primarily concentrated in certain domains, such as human health and agriculture, they
could spread downstream to other sectors and to society more broadly.




Biological advances create new capabilities that, in combination, could lead to sweeping
change in economies and societies. The changes they will likely bring could be broad-based in
many respects, and there is one aspect in which biological sciences are unique: the significant
risks they entail. We turn to a discussion of risks in the next chapter.

3. Profound and unique
   risks and issues
  Biology is rich with possibility and opportunity, but also fraught with risks. It will preserve life
  through innovative treatments tailored to our genomes and microbiomes. But biology could
  also be the greatest threat to life if it is used to create bioweapons or viruses that forever
  poison ecosystems. It may even be that some of the unique risks associated with biology
  could outweigh the potential benefits of some applications.

  Issues of data privacy and consent that are already being fiercely debated in the case of
  digital technologies and AI are even more pressing in biology, where the data being gathered
  come from our bodies and minds, and couldn’t be more personal and sensitive. And there is
  another paradigm shift from digital. We can unplug a computer, but biology, once unleashed,
  may not easily be switched off. Biological organisms are, by their nature, self-sustaining and
  self-replicating. Genetically engineered viruses and living microbes, plants, and animals may
  be able to reproduce and sustain themselves in the very long term. Genetic engineering has
  permanence. Gene therapy will alter an individual’s health for life, and germline editing will
  affect all of a person’s descendants.122 Once Pandora’s box is opened—and we have already
  cracked the lid—we could have little control over what happens next.

  The risks of bio innovation demand a serious and considered response from governments,
  scientists, regulators, and society. One complication here is that jurisdictional norms vary, as
  do the overall approaches to risk, risk prevention, and competition. New thinking is needed,
  perhaps drawing on how previous waves of technology with significant associated risks,
  including recombinant DNA experimentation in the field of biology itself, have been handled.123


  Biology is self-replicating, is self-sustaining, and does not respect
  jurisdictional boundaries
  In a bid to combat the loss of life caused by the spread of infectious diseases, scientists have
  been developing gene drives that permanently alter the genes of the vectors (like mosquitoes
  in the case of malaria) that spread those diseases. The benefits to global public health could
  be enormous, but there could be unforeseen and uncontrollable consequences. Gene drives
  released into the wild can affect an entire ecosystem. Moreover, genetically altered viruses
  and living microbes, plants, and animals may be able to reproduce and sustain themselves
  into the very long term. For instance, gene-edited mosquitoes are now breeding in Brazil
  despite the fact that the intention of researchers had been that all released mosquitoes and
  their offspring should have died.124 Although the aim of gene drives is for “useful” genetic
  engineering to spread through generations, this ability to spread and self-sustain is, in itself,
  a risk. One scientist has posited that there could be a negative impact on human health if
  the malaria parasite were to evolve to become more virulent or even be carried by a host other
  than the mosquito.125

     The National Academy of Sciences has warned that “considerable gaps in knowledge” remain
     about gene drives’ ecological and evolutionary effects.126 Some efforts are under way to cope
     with challenges and better understand risks. For example, rules to govern the transfer of
     gene drives from the laboratory into future field tests and wider use are being developed.127
     In addition, precautions against the accidental release of gene drives are being put in place,
     including, for instance, systems to limit the spread of gene drives only to the populations
     targeted.128 The risks of unanticipated effects can also be reduced by progressive
     evaluation from laboratory to field cages prior to open-field trial in isolated populations,
     allowing for systematic assessment of possible environmental effects under increasingly
     natural conditions. A team called Target Malaria working in Italy has introduced changing
     environmental conditions to field cages and developing ecological models so that researchers
     can better explore the benefits and risks of wild releases in a safe but effective way.129

     Genetic editing of plants and animals raises the risk of outcrossing—the potential of mixing
     engineered genes into wild populations and native species—and potential reduction in
     the biodiversity of plants and animals.130


     The interconnected nature of biology can increase the potential for
     unintended consequences
     Biology is personal in that its foundation is built on some of the most fundamental units in
     our bodies, DNA, yet it is also highly interconnected. Changes to one part of the system
     can have cascading effects and unintended consequences across entire ecosystems or
     species. Even legitimate and well-intentioned use of biological technologies carries systemic
     risk. Successful gene editing, for instance, could have “off-target” effects beyond those
     intended. “Off-target” mutations have been observed for all classes of genome editing tools
     used to date, including CRISPR.131 It is not yet known whether genetic engineering applied
     to sperm, eggs, or embryos could have unintended negative consequences if passed down
     through generations.

     Gene therapies offered to consumers may have side effects and unknown long-term
     consequences that are not properly understood today. Such therapies need to be proven
     safe and effective in animal models before they can be tested in humans, let alone approved
     for treatments.


     Low barriers to entry open the door to potential misuse with potentially
     serious—even fatal—consequences
     Unlike nuclear materials, some biological technologies are relatively cheap and accessible.
     There is today a thriving community of “biohackers” who practice synthetic biology or CRISPR
     genome editing in community labs or on their own as a hobby. The Netflix documentary series
     Unnatural Selection, which had its premiere in October 2019, highlights some examples,
     including an individual selling $100 CRISPR kits from his garage and a biohacker who
     injected himself in a DIY gene edit.132 Commercial kits to perform CRISPR alterations are sold

commercially on the internet. So far, these movements have appeared to be harmless, but
nobody can guarantee that a hobby won’t turn into something more sinister. There does now
appear to be some regulatory scrutiny in this area.133

Nevertheless, the risk exists that technologies such as those used to edit microbes or
viruses could be misused by people with hostile motivations or without a sufficient sense
of responsibility. An individual with some specialized knowledge could, for example, create
a virus tailored to specific people based on information in their genome.134 Unlike, for example,
an attempt to buy nuclear materials, purchasing the components needed to create such
a tool would not raise red flags with regulators. The cost of eradicating a virus is exorbitant. In
the case of smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases in history, it took decades and cost billions
of dollars.135 Yet resurrecting an extinct virus could be relatively inexpensive and simple.
One small team of Canadian researchers reconstituted an extinct poxvirus—against which
vaccinations had ended years ago—in 2017 at a cost of about $100,000 using mail-order
DNA. Yet consider the cost of eradicating such pathogens.

Low barriers could also raise the risk of unethical corporate practices, for example if
companies were to commercialize biology-based products or services before the relevant
science has been fully tested and validated.


Differing value systems make it hard to forge consensus, including on
life-and-death issues
Scientific advances are raising significant ethical questions. Embryo screening, selection,
and editing could lead to human traits being artificially selected, raising enormous concerns.
For example, the ability to edit out disabilities before birth may be seen as “playing God.”
Where should the line be drawn? Is it right to edit the genome of an embryo to prevent sickle
cell anemia, but wrong to choose a baby’s skin or eye color? Finding common answers to
such questions is challenging because differing value systems are involved—at the individual,
cultural, and national levels. Technical and scientific issues like embryo editing quickly
become moral questions.

In the—arguably far—future, it may be possible to use genetic data to calibrate education and
training programs, but this raises significant ethical issues. Even suggesting that children’s
education or workers’ training should be based on their genes raises red flags. Not only could
such approaches be interpreted as social determinism, but they risk reinforcing inequality.

Societal norms and acceptance differ between cultures and countries, guided by a range
of religious, ethical, cultural, and historical values. Scientific advances in some sensitive
areas may be shunned by some countries but viewed as a unique competitive advantage
for businesses or economies in others, with the potential commercial gains overriding
the desirability of unified regulation.


Privacy and consent issues are fundamental in this deeply
intimate sphere
Concerns about personal privacy and consent in the digital age are debated widely. There is
already a popular backlash against the gathering of private data about shopping habits, for
instance. This discomfort about data mining could be much greater in the case of biological
uses because the data being gathered couldn’t be more personal—from our bodies and
minds. Omics data is so information-rich that, even when it is anonymized and aggregated,

     individuals may still be identifiable, and sensitive personal or medical information could
     be exposed.

     The explosion of available biological data is fueling innovation, but concern is widespread.
     In the United States, so many individuals had taken DTC genetic tests that it was possible
     to access material from open databases and identify about 60 percent of Americans with
     European ancestry from a DNA sample as of late 2018.136 This prompted some DTC companies
     to tighten up the availability of such data.137 Some individuals identified through these
     methods never gave consent or received genetic testing themselves; rather, their family
     members did. There are also consent concerns with newborn testing, to which parents agreed
     on their children’s behalf, but the data can affect the individuals all their lives. Finally, we are all
     familiar with data regulations that require us to click on the “accept” button on all the websites
     we visit to give consent to our data being gathered.138 But consumers are not always informed
     about how their DNA—gathered during a genetic test—is shared with third parties. This has
     led to some DTC genetic testing companies separating consent to be tested from consent to
     the storage, use, and sale of test results.

     Citizens’ privacy may not be protected when law enforcement agencies ask for data.
     FamilyTreeDNA had to apologize for not disclosing an agreement with the FBI that gave
     the bureau routine access to its database. In the aftermath, the company decided to introduce
     an opting-out choice to customers.139 Improved DNA sequencing led to the capture of
     the so-called Golden State Killer in 2018, but the case highlighted consent issues. After
     the case, GEDMatch changed its privacy policy to limit law enforcement access only to
     profiles of users who have given permission; this led to a 95 percent reduction in profiles
     available to police.140 Governments and security agencies are already grappling with the need
     to balance security with citizens’ privacy rights. It is possible that members of the public will be
     even less comfortable with their government holding their DNA than with private companies
     doing so.

     In the future, there may be more sophisticated headsets that read brain signals and can
     discern a patient’s mental state, a potentially useful tool in therapy. In 2013, Carnegie Mellon
     University researchers reported monitoring subjects’ mental states using a machine that
     recognized the emotions they experienced to a reasonable level of accuracy.141 Theoretically,
     such a machine could be used in law enforcement and in the courts to read a person’s
     emotional reaction to questioning or an evidentiary statement—a new lie detector. But this
     use of the technology appears to represent a significant invasion of privacy. Some biomachine
     interface technologies could even pose risks to national security. The ability to read brain
     signals in brain-based communications could result in unintentional transmission of sensitive
     information or national intelligence. Surgically implanted brain-computer interfaces could
     pose a security threat if hackers are able to invade the systems and hijack individuals’
     behavior or action.


     Unequal access could perpetuate socioeconomic disparities, with
     potentially regressive effects
     Biological advances and their impact on economies and societies could reinforce and widen
     inequality between the wealthy and less well-off within countries, and between nations.

The changes are advancing quickest and most broadly in relatively rich countries, and
there is a danger that these technologies could be heavily concentrated in countries with
the means to invest in their development. Adoption of healthcare-related omics and molecular
technologies varies enormously among countries. It is happening in high-income countries
as well as China, which is ahead of developed economies on the advancement and adoption
of some of these innovative technologies.142 In the case of CAR T‑cell research, for example,
more active trials are being held in China than in the European Union (EU), Japan, and
the United States combined.143 Overall, our analysis finds that countries with high readings on
the socio-demographic index account for roughly 30 percent of today’s global disease burden
(the number of individuals with sickle cell anemia is highest in Africa, for example), but those
countries could gain about 70 percent of the total reduction in the global disease burden
from the deployment of biological advances.144 This reflects the high price of, and the need for,
specialized infrastructure, supply chains, and talent to support innovative treatments such as
CAR T‑cell therapies.

Within countries, access to beneficial biological applications may be open only to the wealthy
given that many of the applications remain expensive. Neuroprosthetics are biomachine
interfaces where limbs are controlled with considerable precision by linking up directly to,
and reading, brain signals. Healthcare systems in many countries may not be able to afford to
offer neuroprosthetics to patients at current prices. For example, the cost of lower extremity
limbs ranges from $5,000 to $50,000, and upper extremity limbs from $3,000 to $30,000.145
A gene therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy approved for use in the United
States costs $2.1 million for a single use.146 If healthcare systems do not pay for all or some
of the costs of these treatments, they will remain the preserve of the minority that is able to
afford them. There is also a risk that, used or analyzed in a biased way, genetic data could
discriminate against certain groups in society, including women and different ethnic groups.147
This built-in bias could mean that patients are treated differently when matched to providers,
with a knock-on effect on insurance premiums and employment.

Finally, biological applications that edit out “less desirable” traits could lead to outcomes that
are regressive and disenfranchise marginalized groups. Many genetic mutations result in
conditions that society considers to be disorders or health complications and that form a core
part of a group’s identity (for instance, achondroplasia or dwarfism). Any developments that
purport to “fix” the genetic mutations experienced by these groups may seem demeaning.


These issues demand a considered response and, potentially, new
approaches to safeguarding and oversight
The unique risks and issues raised by biological advances demand a considered response.
In the case of past technological innovation, governments, scientists, and regulators often
arrived at risk-management systems in response to crises. In this case, however, given
the persistence and severity of the risks, a wait-and-see attitude and experimentation may
not be sufficient. New approaches could be needed. Regulation is an important part of
the necessary response, but not the whole story. Systems are needed to detect, monitor,
and intervene in scientific developments. Scientists themselves can play a role in building
safeguards into new biological technologies.148

     Any response to the risks that is purely national might not be effective, given the ineluctable
     fact that biology does not respect borders—a gene drive approved and conducted in one
     country may affect neighboring countries with or without their consent—and there are already
     signs of regulation unfolding unevenly in jurisdictions with multiple value systems.

     That said, developing national standards is an important first step. In the United Kingdom,
     the independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was set up in 1991 to provide advice to policy
     makers and stimulate public debate on bioethics. Since 1994, it has been funded jointly by
     the Nuffield Foundation, Wellcome, and the Medical Research Council.149 The Parliamentary
     Office of Science and Technology takes a role in overseeing advances in biology, including
     genetic engineering.150 In the United States, President Barack Obama convened a commission
     for the study of bioethical issues to explore and set ethical boundaries. The commission
     identified five ethical principles: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual
     freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation, and justice and fairness.151

     However, without global standards and agreements, there is still a risk of a biological
     regulatory “race to the bottom” with some governments taking a more laissez-faire approach
     to ethical considerations for competitive reasons, putting pressure on more cautious
     governments to follow suit. Many countries are signatories to the Biological Weapons
     Convention, but not all nations are equally bound by similar codes of conduct outside
     of the use of biology for weapons, and some may continue to take different regulatory
     approaches in this area. Global consensus on standards may prove difficult to achieve.

     Governments, regulators, and the scientific community need to be proactive in engaging with
     the public.152 Citizens on the ground will need to have an informed opinion about the trade-
     offs they are prepared or not prepared to accept and will need their voices heard. The view
     of those trade-offs may well vary. For instance, citizens of a country where malaria continues
     to affect many lives may be more willing to accept gene-edited organisms. Engaging
     with the public too late can have serious repercussions. Some work has already been
     done on the benefits of real-time technology assessment, anticipatory governance, and
     upstream engagement.153

     Arguably, the global scientific community has already been more proactive on the potential
     hazards of bio innovation than on nuclear physics and AI. In 1975, the Asilomar Conference
     convened an international group of mostly scientists to review scientific progress in research
     on recombinant DNA molecules and discuss ways of dealing with the potential biohazards
     the work could entail.154 Regulation and oversight need to be adaptable, responding to
     technological breakthroughs as they happen—or, ideally, anticipating them.

     New tools to oversee science as it develops are necessary. One idea is to ensure that all
     research studies that have been vetted for ethical content are placed in an open registry.
     Another is for researchers to develop an early-warning system that enables them to report
     any research that risks overstepping ethical boundaries. One approach that could be
     borrowed from AI—which has its own ethical challenges—is for “red teams” of academics,

ethicists, and practitioners to audit and review models before they are deployed.155 The same
approach could be applied to biological applications, such as new genetically engineered
strains of crops or animals, when they move from the lab to the field. Research institutions and
funders should define and then monitor clear protocols.156 In many cases, an interdisciplinary
approach will be necessary given that these issues—gene drives included—go beyond
the technical to social, ethical, and legal dimensions.




The many risks that come with advances in biology raise significant questions for citizens and
regulators. They could be one of the most formidable barriers to the progress of biological
advances. Careful thinking will be needed about the tools and tactics, including potential
new approaches, that may be required to mitigate or minimize certain types of risk. The next
chapter turns to scenarios for the adoption of applications and their impact in the near and
longer term.

4. The path to adoption
   and impact
  The speed with which biological applications move from the lab to commercial adoption will
  depend on many factors, including the progress of scientific research, whether the economics
  of a particular application work, and how weak or strong public and regulatory acceptance
  proves to be.

  The journey to adoption may take years for many applications. Nevertheless, major progress
  is being made. For this research, we examined a wide range of specific areas of application
  and compiled a library of about 400 use cases, most of which are scientifically feasible
  today and which could have economic impact in the next ten to 20 years. The library is
  not exhaustive, but it nonetheless provides some idea of the pipeline for the years ahead.
  The impact could potentially be even higher for a number of reasons, including spillover
  effects across the economy.

  In this chapter, we examine and seek to assess the potential impact of these applications
  over the next three decades, based on our analysis of the use case library. We also examine
  the factors that could speed up or slow down their journey to adoption.


  A visible pipeline of applications could have broad impact in ten to 20
  years, with more beyond
  While biological sciences have been evolving for years, they have now reached a new phase of
  growth at which applications have sufficient scientific underpinnings and compelling enough
  economics for us to anticipate adoption that produces economic impact within the next ten
  to 20 years. This will be only one wave of impact. The impact is likely to be larger as it spreads
  upstream, downstream, and to ancillary players, potentially transforming value chains, and
  catalyzing the creation of new business models and players in nearly all sectors.

  Biological applications could unlock an estimated $2 trillion to $4 trillion in annual direct
  global economic impact
  We gathered about 400 detailed use cases that employ elements of biological technologies—
  or look likely to do so in the future. We surveyed these applications by examining the visible
  pipeline of relevant applications, from publications such as research papers. We then tested
  the applications with a variety of scientific and industry experts. The direct economic impact
  of each use case depends on adoption volume and value gain. We assessed four drivers of
  value gains: reduced disease burden translated to economic productivity, greater willingness
  to pay more for improved quality, cost productivity, and environmental benefit (see Box 2,
  “Estimating potential direct economic value,” and the technical appendix for full details of
  the methodology). Taken together, we estimate that over the next ten to 20 years, biological
  applications could have direct annual economic impact of between about $2 trillion and
  $4 trillion globally (Exhibit 7).

     Box 2
     Estimating potential direct economic value

     The library of about 400 use cases compiled for this research is a visible pipeline of
     innovations under way and lying ahead. To compile the library, we first defined which
     technologies fell within the scope of the Bio Revolution as defined in this research. We then
     identified a pipeline of applications that could produce tangible benefits from those emerging
     technologies. The library includes use cases that are scientifically conceivable today and
     could plausibly be adopted by 2050. It excludes applications that are not scientifically
     conceivable today (for instance, steel production via biological means) or are unlikely to have
     material impact by 2050. All technologies described in chapter 1 are included. We excluded
     technologies that are already commercially mature. We tested the use cases with a range of
     experts to better understand economic potential and adoption timing.

     This library, while extensive, is not exhaustive. For instance, there are applications that
     we cannot identify today due to limited public information—many innovations are being
     developed in private labs or in the defense industry, where developments remain confidential
     for commercial or national security reasons. In addition, while we sought input from a wide
     range of experts, that input was not exhaustive.

     To estimate the tangible impact of these applications (which is expressed in annual global
     terms relative to the 2020 economy), we focused on use cases in biology-centric domains
     where core products or services could be inherently biological (Exhibit 6). Domains include
     multiple sectors, such as human health and performance, which includes both healthcare
     systems and services and pharmaceutical and medical products. We then estimated
     the direct impact by sizing four value gain drivers: reduced disease burden translated to
     economic productivity, improved quality (expressed through greater willingness to pay), cost
     productivity (for instance, incremental cost saving to make products), and environmental
     benefit (from reduced greenhouse gas emissions).

     Using expert input and historical analogs, we extrapolated our assessed impact to different
     time horizons by estimating how long it might take for an application to achieve scientific
     feasibility, commercial availability, and then peak impact. We acknowledge that adoption
     levels and timing may be subject to many uncertainties, including shifting product features
     and customer demographics, that may not be fully captured in our assessment. Adoption was
     modeled based on innovation-adoption curves that varied depending on the type of use case
     to allocate the impact to different time horizons.

                                      All applications with economic potential in the next decade are scientifically feasible today,
                                      with the majority already commercialized in market. In the longer term, roughly 60 percent
                                      of the potential economic impact from the use cases sized is already commercially available
                                      today, with less than 15 percent not scientifically feasible today. The wide ranges in
                                      the estimates of impact reflect uncertainties about the pace and extent of commercialization
                                      and adoption.

                                      There are two broad categories of applications: those that garner insights from
                                      the sequencing and analysis of biological data, and applications that depend on
                                      the manipulation of biology through genetic, cell, and tissue engineering.

                                      The former—the analysis of genomic, microbiome, neural, and other biological data and
                                      the application of insights to enable precision and personalization on an unprecedented
                                                          REPEATS
                                      scale—will dominate impact in the short term. Faster computation and the increasing use
                                      and sophistication of analytics and AI will make it possible to derive more insights from
                                                          ES and Report
                                      biological data and predict biological associations and processes. In agriculture, tapping into
                                      large libraries of genetic and microbe data will likely enable farming to be tailored for desired

                                      outcomes under distinct local conditions in specific sites. Using similar data pools, products
                                      and services can be tailored to the genetic profile and microbiome composition of consumers.
                                      Indeed, over the next ten years, even if there are no further advances in the ways that biology
                                      is engineered, an enormous amount of value can be created purely by analyzing the exploding
                                      amount of biological data now being gathered. We estimate that this could amount to between
                                      about $400 billion and $900 billion, more than half of the total potential direct impact.

                                      However, it is likely that impact from the second type of application—engineering biology—
                                      will grow faster. As scientific (and regulatory and commercial) challenges are overcome,
                                      techniques to engineer biology such as CRISPR will add to the value that is already being
                                      created through biological data analysis (Exhibit 8). By the medium term—from 2030 to
                                      2040—the tables will have turned, and biological engineering could account for the majority
                                      of the overall direct annual impact, about 60 percent. We estimate that the impact could
                                      amount to between about $900 billion and $2.2 trillion per year.

     The most direct impact will appear in life science and human-centric domains
     Human health and performance have the most scientific advances and the clearest pipeline
     from research to application. The science is advanced, and the market is generally accepting
     of innovations. However, based on our use cases, the impact could be far more broad-based:
     in the next ten to 20 years, more than half of the direct impact is likely to be outside health,
     primarily in agriculture and consumer products.

     Our use case library suggests that most value related to bio innovations in the next one to
     two decades will come in four domains, or clusters of sectors where many applications are
     emerging from bio innovation. The four are human health and performance; agriculture,
     aquaculture, and food; consumer products and services; and materials, chemicals, and
     energy. The ranges of impact, and shares of impact, in human health and performance and
     in consumer products and services includes some impact from biomachine interfaces.
     Applications in some other sectors could also be on the path to adoption, including in
     the areas of undoing environmental harm, education, security, and space exploration
     (Exhibit 9).

     — Human health and performance. Applications include cell, gene, and RNA therapies
       to treat or even prevent disease, a range of anti-aging treatments to extend life spans,
       innovations in reproductive medicine, and improvements to drug development and
       delivery. The impact here could amount to between $500 billion and $1.3 trillion over
       the next ten to 20 years, or 35 percent of the overall impact that we estimate for this
       period. The greatest potential source of value is increased workforce productivity from
       a reduction in the global burden of disease, due to advances in preventing, diagnosing,
       and treating diseases (notably cancer and infectious diseases) and in anti-aging therapies.
       We estimate between 1 and 3 percent of the total global burden of disease could be
       reduced in the next ten to 20 years from these applications—roughly the equivalent of
       eliminating the global disease burden of lung cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer
       combined. Such advances could have significant spillover effects on other industries.
       For instance, longer life spans could affect the life insurance industry. Adoption of
       applications and therefore the timing of impact will vary. Shorter-term impact is expected
       from reducing the disease burden from therapeutic areas where cell and gene therapies
       already exist, including, for instance, treatments for certain types of monogenic diseases
       and cancer. In the longer term, innovations are likely to spread to more therapeutic areas
       such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Anti-aging therapies may also
       come to fruition in the longer term. In reproductive medicine, genetic screening of parents
       and embryos for certain medical conditions already exists. In the longer term, embryo
       editing for medical purposes could emerge. Practically all of the impact in human health is
       influenced by accelerated research as well as genetic-level personalization and precision.

     — Agriculture, aquaculture, and food. Applications include innovative ways to conduct
       marker-assisted breeding of animals and plants using genetic markers that are many
       times quicker than traditional selective breeding methods; new, more precise tools for
       the genetic engineering of plants (that is, without introducing foreign genetic materials);
       fast-developing work using the microbiome of plants, soil, animals, and water to improve
       the quality and productivity of agricultural production; and the development of alternative
       proteins, including lab-grown meat. Annual direct impact could be an estimated
       $800 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next ten to 20 years, or 36 percent of the total.
       The greatest impact may well come from marker-assisted breeding, genetic engineering
       of plant and animal traits, microbiome mapping and modification, and alternative proteins.
       Innovation in crop and livestock farming has helped feed the world, and the bio innovations
       now being commercialized build on this by giving us new tools to meet ever more pressing
       challenges in ensuring food security for a growing global population and managing
       depleting natural resources more sustainably. Global food systems are relevant to all of




62   McKinsey Global Institute


      the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.157 The science is progressing quickly,
      but consumer reaction and regulatory constraints are the bigger barriers in some regions.
      In the short term, impact is expected from the application of insights from biological
      data to measure food safety and quality and to improve selective breeding decisions.
      Novel plant-based meats may see some adoption. In the medium term, there could be
      a range of genetically engineered traits with CRISPR in plants as well as impact from
      screening the microbiome in agricultural production and subsequently optimizing the use
      of agricultural inputs. Cultured meat could also hit the market. In addition, there could be
      impact from genetically engineered traits with CRISPR in animals, potentially faster in
      some regions than others, depending on the regulatory stance.

— Consumer products and services. Opportunities are opening up to use increasing
  volumes of biological data to offer consumers personalized products and services based
  on their biological makeup. Applications include DTC genetic and microbiome testing,
  beauty and personal care increasingly based on greater knowledge of the microbiome as
  testing spreads, and innovative approaches to wellness, including fitness and nutrition,
  not only in humans but in pets.158 Annual economic impact over the next ten to 20 years
  could be between $200 billion and $800 billion, or 19 percent of the total. Roughly two-
  thirds of the impact is driven by personalization, demonstrating the core importance of
  tailoring to impact. The largest impact in this domain comes from wellness applications
  related to monitoring nutrition, fitness, and personal health based on omics data, and
  personalized probiotics and vitamins. In the short term, impact is expected from insights
  based on DTC genetic and microbiome testing that enables personalization of related
  products and services for both consumers and pets. In the medium term, there could be
  improvements in wellness applications such as personalized fitness and diet based on new
  ways to measure omics and other biological data in a noninvasive manner. In the longer
  term, depending on funding and regulation, impact could come from nonmedical gene
  therapies for cosmetic uses.

— Materials, chemicals, and energy. Bio innovations could help to improve how these
  physical inputs are produced, in some cases substituting or complementing existing
  products with new ones that have improved performance or novel characteristics that
  offer societal benefits—often more sustainably. Applications include innovations related
  to materials production, such as improved fermentation processes, new bioroutes
  utilizing the ability to edit the DNA of microbes to develop novel materials with entirely
  new properties (self-repairing fabrics are one example; another is making leather using
  mushrooms instead of animal hide), and building on advances in biofuels to innovate new
  forms of energy storage. Over the next ten to 20 years, this domain could account for
  direct impact of $200 billion to $300 billion a year, or 8 percent of the total. The greatest
  potential source of value is efficiency (cost savings) in the production of materials such
  as nylon, silk, cotton, and clothing dyes using fermentation due to improved fermentation
  processes and new bioroutes. Our assumptions about impact in this domain are
  conservative because promised innovation in the past has not materialized and because it
  is not known what novel materials will be developed. In the short term, impact is expected
  from increased efficiency in existing fermentation processes and potential new bioroutes
  to creating existing materials such as fabrics and food and feed ingredients. In the medium
  term, there may be impact from the production of completely novel materials. In the longer
  term, applications such as biobatteries could emerge.

      We include wellness, nutrition, and fitness in consumer products and services rather than health because they tend not
      be mediated by healthcare professionals but consumed directly by individuals, and are subject to choice—consumers
      choose to consume biological products and services such as skin and beauty products and DTC testing. While some
      consumer applications, including, for instance, consumer wearables, may have impact on the disease burden, they are
      not direct treatments or therapies.

     — Sustainability and other applications. Beyond these four core areas, we found
       a range of potential applications in other sectors, including environmental management,
       education, security, and space exploration. Applications include biosequestration and
       bioremediation that could help to address environmental challenges, the enhanced use of
       DNA sequencing for solving crimes, and potentially personalized learning using genetic
       profiles. In all, we estimate that applications in sustainability, education, and security (we
       did not size the potential in defense) could have a total impact of between about $25 billion
       and $45 billion over the next ten to 20 years, or less than 1 percent of the total impact in
       that time frame, although the potential could be greater further out. Of these applications,
       some with the most potential value could undo environmental harm with three categories
       of potential applications: bioremediation, biosequestration of CO2, and monitoring for
       diversity and signs of ecological damage. Some possible applications are emerging in
       education, such as personalized learning programs tailored based on genomes, and in
       security, including, for instance, using DNA testing as biometric verification (for example,
       to execute financial transactions). These applications are nascent and are fraught with
       enormous risks and ethical concerns. Finally, bio innovations could aid space exploration
       by enhancing the health of astronauts and even develop habitats in space, although any
       economically significant impact is not likely to emerge before 2050. Overall, applications
       in these areas are less advanced in scientific feasibility and potential commercialization,
       and their adoption may face significant ethical hurdles.

     In addition to impact from applications in biomolecules and biosystems, potential impact is
     also emerging in biomachine interfaces and biocomputing. The science and development is at
     an early stage, but some applications already appear promising. The impact is likely to appear
     in a range of domains, including human health and performance, and in consumer products
     and services, but over longer time horizons.

     — Biomachine interfaces. Over the past decade, the development of more complex and
       advanced algorithms and systems has made possible the development of biomachine
       interfaces—between brains and computers. Over the next ten to 20 years, the annual
       impact could range between about $70 billion and $200 billion, or 5 percent of the total. In
       this case, biomachine interfaces could create impact in several of the domains described.
       For example, neuroprosthetics restoring hearing or vision would improve human health
       and performance. Applications such as headbands for monitoring stress levels from
       electric signals would apply in consumer products and services.

     — Biocomputing. As noted in chapter 1, this field could contribute to information and
       communications technologies, because data could be stored on DNA. Commercially
       usable nucleic acid storage and biology-based parallel computing are not likely to
       become commercially significant before 2050 given the significant challenges that need
       to be overcome, such as prohibitive cost and limited speed. Nonetheless, taking a long-
       term view, we estimate that biocomputing applications could create impact of between
       $5 billion and $15 billion in the years beyond 2050.

     The total economic impact will be larger than the direct impact of these use cases
     This direct impact estimated across the domains may be only a small portion of the potential
     scale of impact. Even in the near term, the impact could be larger as new scientific
     breakthroughs emerge and as the direct impact we note above starts to have knock-on
     effects or spills over to other sectors. Beyond the initial direct impact, we are likely to see
     a second wave that affects other sectors that are upstream, downstream, or ancillary. In
     the longer term, more broadly, the impact could radiate out to every sector of the economy
     with effects on society and the environment. Considering the visible pipeline of applications
     we sized in the human health domain, between 1 and 3 percent of the total global burden
     of disease could be reduced in the next ten to 20 years from these applications. While this
     near-term impact is significant, it is only a fraction of the transformational change that may be
     achievable. Many factors will shape the full extent of impact and the ability to capture as much
     of the full potential as possible, such as funding for basic science and treatments that can
     pass clinical trials and are commercially viable alternatives to existing treatments. In general,
     the total economic impact will exceed our estimates of the direct impact for a number of
     reasons (Exhibit 10). They include the following:

     — Unassessed use cases. Our library of about 400 use cases, while extensive, is not
       exhaustive. We acknowledge that there are many use cases we cannot identify today due
       to limited public information—many innovations are being developed in private labs or in
       the defense industry, where developments remain confidential for commercial or national
       security reasons.

     — Faster and higher adoption. A range of factors could accelerate adoption of scientific
       advances. Companies could help speed up time to market and adoption of some
       applications by increasing investment, focusing on scientific advances and technologies
       that are likely to have the most impact, and/or partnering with innovative startups. In
       addition to adoption speed, peak adoption levels may continue to increase due to factors
       such as shifting product features, customer preferences, and lower price. For example, we
       could see faster adoption or higher adoption levels of expensive therapies (for example,
       CAR T‑cell therapy for cancer) resulting from broader insurance coverage.

     — Knock-on economic effects. The impact of some applications could in turn have knock-
       on economic effects. For example, improved health could mean that people lead longer
       and more productive lives; a potential boost in economic contribution is one of the key
       components of direct economic impact we have assessed. In addition, longer lives and
       healthier populations have potentially far-reaching implications. Retirement ages may
       rise, demand for eldercare delivered in the home may also rise, and social security and
       pensions may need to adapt. Or, if alternative proteins replace some meat production,
       land now dedicated to grazing could be repurposed for conservation efforts or new
       commercial uses.

     — Impacts on upstream, downstream and ancillary players. After the first wave of
       innovations in the domains directly affected by the bio innovations, a second wave
       of innovations may spill over into a broader segment of the economy, transforming
       value chains and encouraging new business models and players in nearly all parts of
       the economy. For example, in the case of applications in agriculture, aquaculture, and
       food, there will be innovations that diffuse into food retailing, for instance. Numerous
       fast-food chains have announced deals with plant-based meat-substitute producers to
       offer vegetarian and vegan versions of popular menu items. Logistics and transportation
       players may adapt to genetically engineered produce that can be kept fresh for far longer
       than its conventional counterparts even without being refrigerated, and to increased
       demand for alternative proteins. In the longer term, every domain of the economy may be
       affected as bio innovation transforms profit pools, value chains, and business models.

— Existing scientific breakthroughs spur more breakthroughs. Some innovations
  have the ability to generate more innovations. They do so by helping to improve existing
  products and processes or by inventing and implementing new ones. For example,
  the Human Genome Project initially set out to determine a map of the human genome.
  In doing so, the HGP was instrumental in pushing the development of high-throughput
  technologies for preparing, mapping, and sequencing DNA. The improved ability to
  sequence DNA has, in turn, led to sequencing of the genomes of microbes, plants, and
  animals, which has advanced many fields of science, including microbiology, virology,
  infectious disease, and plant biology. In addition, new biology and new technologies
  brought about by the HGP have enabled many other large-scale research initiatives to
  go forward. Examples include the ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) research
  consortium, International HapMap Project, 1000 Genomes, Cancer Genome Anatomy
  Project, Human Microbiome Project, and Roadmap Epigenomics Project.159

— New scientific breakthroughs enabling more commercial applications. Biology
  research is continually developing, and more scientific breakthroughs could provide
  a foundation for downstream commercial applications that may become available in
  the next few decades. For example, before the Human Genome Project, researchers
  knew the genetic basis of tens of disorders. Today, they know the basis of thousands of
  conditions. Genomics is thus helping transform medicine. More than 100 different FDA-
  approved drugs are now packaged with instructions that tell doctors to test their patients
  for genetic variants linked to efficacy, dosages, or risky side effects.160 Funding basic
  science or helping promising applications accelerate through research pipelines could
  directly influence the number of commercial applications in the future, beyond use cases
  we may have missed in our sizing.

In the longer term, biological advances could have even broader effects across society,
helping to address key challenges. Health is one example; it could be improved by innovations
not only in healthcare but in other sectors. One example is chemicals such as nutraceuticals
and sugar replacements, which could potentially improve the health of populations.
Controlling the quality of meat grown in labs may be easier than when compared with living
animals, and this may reduce the negative health consequences from antibiotics and growth
hormones commonly used in animal agriculture. In addition, improved accuracy and cost-
effectiveness of DNA sequencing, leading to widespread adoption, may reduce foodborne
illnesses and allergic reactions. Personal insights into health risks and lifestyle aspects such
as fitness and nutrition could improve the health of populations via personalized fitness
and diet.

For now, we don’t have certainty into the degree to which these potential societal effects will
be realized. Nonetheless, based on what we can see already today, we observe that there
could be potential for biological implications in the following areas:

— Sustainable development, environment. Climate change is one area where biology
  could play an important role. By 2040 to 2050, the direct applications we sized could
  reduce annual average man-made GHG emissions by 7 to 9 percent from 2018 levels,
  or up to eight times the total CO2 emissions from the global airline industry in 2018.161
  This would come from a variety of applications such as a shift toward new bioroutes for
  production and alternative proteins. The knock-on effects include alleviating pressure
  on cropland and reducing deforestation. Adopting bio innovations, such as using more
  sustainable inputs rather than plastics, could address other environmental challenges
  such as waste. At the same time, there is also potential for some of these applications
  to have unintended consequences on species or ecosystems, given the interconnected
  nature of biological systems (see chapter 6.5 for other biological applications focused
  on sustainability).

— Sustainable development, food security. There is also potential to improve food security
  and reduce world hunger and malnutrition through agricultural applications. The Bill &
  Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, suggests that by using improved fertilizer and
  more productive crops such as genetically engineered varieties, African farmers could
  theoretically double their yields.162 New portable DNA sequencing devices developed
  by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which first appeared in Africa for Ebola surveillance,
  can empower farmers on the continent to better fight crop disease—but they remain
  expensive at $1,000 apiece, and adoption may take off only as the price comes down.
  Through the Cassava Virus Action Project, the pocket DNA sequencers allow rural
  farmers in East Africa to receive actionable insights about viruses in real time (compared
  with the normal three months) for the first time.163 Reducing the cost and health risk or
  improving the shelf life of various foods could have broad-reaching implications for global
  hunger. More effective biopesticides and biofertilizers may lead to more efficient crop
  production systems and potentially contribute to reducing world hunger.

— Workforce. Bio innovations also have workforce implications. Demand for people with
  expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, bioengineering, machine learning,
  and data analytics skills will rise as talent starts to drive commercialization. A key
  question is how to ensure that these skills are available to organizations that can develop
  beneficial applications.

— Society. Finally, there are implications for our societal fabric. Our use cases suggest
  that biological applications can already have health benefits in the form of longer and
  more productive life. This comes with broader ramifications. If people live longer and in
  better health, retirement ages and demand for eldercare may rise even further. The way
  we work may change. If we are to live longer, could we spend more time in education
  and start working later? Could we use the additional healthy years of work to develop
  more specialized skills or enjoy a second career? Finally, are we happier as a population
  with increased omics insights and the ability to engineer ourselves? Is that necessarily
  a good thing?

     For all this potential, biological applications will not likely be a panacea for all societal ills
     and challenges. In many ways, the societal effects could occur unevenly, in part driven by
     level of access to these innovations across socioeconomic groups or nations. And, critically,
     the risks of biology will need to be addressed and satisfactorily mitigated if biology is to realize
     its potential.


     Science is the starting point—applications need to be commercialized and
     diffused responsibly to deliver beneficial impact at scale
     In addition to addressing the substantial risks of biological advances, many hurdles still
     need to be overcome if innovations are to reach their full potential and move from the lab to
     health systems, businesses, industry, and consumers. The path to impact and adoption will
     take time. Broadly, the path to adoption has three key stages, which bleed into each other
     into a continuous evolution. The first is the scientific research stage, where an innovation is
     discovered, developed, and tested before it reaches the critical point of scientific feasibility,
     defined as achieving experimental or pilot success in a target population. Once the scientific
     research is complete, commercialization and scaling can theoretically begin. This is the stage
     at which new products and services are developed and tested. When they are launched into
     the market—at which point they are commercially feasible—then diffusion among end users
     can begin.164 The pace and extent of that diffusion will depend on many factors, including
     whether new products and services are cost-competitive with current offerings and whether
     they offer new, superior properties or higher quality. Essentially, new offerings need to be
     meet demand from end users to diffuse.

     For the applications in our library of use cases and for other applications that may emerge
     in the future to diffuse and deliver beneficial impact at scale, six broad factors are likely to
     determine whether an application emerges from an idea, and is then adopted by end users
     and at what pace this journey may proceed. The first—investing in scientific research—is
     germane in the first stage. Four factors—value propositions, business models, go to market,
     and operational scalability—are key for the second and third stages, commercialization and
     diffusion. The sixth relates to risk and mechanisms for governing the use of applications; this
     is vital in all three stages (Exhibit 11).




     164
           We recognize that not all bio innovations will be launched into a traditional “commercial market” including those deployed
           by the public sector. We use “commercial availability” and “market launch” to refer to the general idea that the bio
           innovation has passed sufficient testing that it can now be made available to the target population, in which case the
           diffusion factors apply, for instance, whether the innovation is superior to alternatives.

     Scientific research, funding, tools, talent, and access to data are powerful
     enabling investments
     Today’s innovations were once just ideas. In most cases it took years of research and sizable
     investments to make them scientifically feasible.165 Although the exact course of scientific
     research can be difficult to predict, key types of investment increase the likelihood of more
     advances. They include funding, the development of tools that extend research capabilities,
     talent to sustain the vitality of research, and access to data to build knowledge and
     derive insights.

     — Funding. Scientific research requires considerable investment. For example, the Human
       Genome Project involved $3 billion in investment. Years ago, science was largely
       supported through private patronage—the backing of a prominent person or family—
       church sponsorship, or self-funding. Today, companies, governments, universities,
       nonprofit organizations, and others around the world make substantial investments in
       R&D. Since 2000, total global R&D expenditures have nearly tripled, from $676 billion
       to $2 trillion in current dollars. These funding programs often have systematic evaluation
       processes, which aim to improve the quality of research, and diverse priorities, which
       could affect specific fields of science and engineering.

     — Tools. The development of new tools and technologies in biological sciences has
       extended research capabilities well beyond genome sequencing. CRISPR represents
       a major leap forward in the ability to edit genes. Ever-increasing computing power at
       ever-decreasing cost has underpinned the rapid development of the bioinformatics
       needed to gain insights from omic technology. And noninvasive imaging techniques
       such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET),
       and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have become powerful enablers of biomachine
       interfaces.166 Other important advances include the development of noninvasive neural
       imaging techniques with resolution comparable to that of invasive techniques, as well as
       the creation of safer and more advanced gene delivery techniques that, in combination
       with genome editing tools, can create an end-to-end genetic modification system.

           Technological advances in several fields outside biology are also enabling unprecedented
           quantitative analyses of biological systems. These fields are diverse, including physics,
           electronics, chemistry, nanotechnology, computer science, and information technology.
           In most instances, tools and methods developed for specific applications in their
           respective fields have been adapted for use in probing biological systems. But in many
           cases, the complexity of biological systems presents new challenges that call for creative
           solutions and additional innovation. Microfluidic chips for cell culture with up to 100
           chambers, using techniques drawn from engineering, chemistry, and physics, have been
           designed to hold individual cells and all the microscopic plumbing necessary to add any
           combination of different chemical inputs to those chambers. The chips can be used to test
           how different inputs might cause stem cells to transform into more specific cells needed
           for treatments. They could also be used to test how different combinations of antibiotics
           affect a particular bacterium.




     165
           We define scientific feasibility as experimental success in the target population (for instance, in the case of human health,
           success in humans rather than in mice models). For applications where we could not identify proof of concept in academia
           or industry, we assessed feasibility using sector-specific analogs and expert interviews that estimate how far away
           scientific feasibility might be.
     166
           MRI is a medical imaging technique using magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the
           body. PET is an imaging test that uses a radioactive drug to reveal the status of tissues and organs. MEG is a noninvasive
           neuroimaging technique for direct mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields generated by electrical currents
           occurring naturally in the neurons of the brain.




72   McKinsey Global Institute


— Talent. Maintaining a cadre of highly talented scientists is a critical element in sustaining
  the vitality of research. Doctoral study plays an important role in developing future
  innovations by training the researchers needed to advance knowledge and explore
  new research areas. Over time, the number of research doctorates and other graduate
  degrees awarded in science and engineering shows a strong upward trend. For example,
  in the United States between 1976 and 2016, the number of recipients of science and
  engineering doctorates more than doubled, with an average annual growth rate of
  2 percent.167 Between 2013 and 2017, the number of students graduating with a doctorate
  increased by approximately 8 percent across OECD countries.168 Policies intended to
  ensure more equitable access for men and women have contributed to this trend. Despite
  the importance of doctoral training, the pathway to a scientific career does not begin in
  undergraduate or postgraduate years; rather, an interest in science is kindled in the early
  years of formal education. Every educational and developmental stage is a potential point
  of intervention, and a comprehensive approach to nurturing students’ interest in science
  and engineering must be adopted to address the talent pipeline.

— Access to data. The emergence of annotated and accessible scientific databases, such
  as the Human Genome Project, GenBank, and UniProt, is pivotal to the development
  of a substantial base of accessible knowledge. So too has been the development of
  a wealth of information and best practices related to modeling organisms, including
  E. coli, C. elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana; knowledge about, and experience with,
  cell and tissue culturing; and the building of a substantial base of knowledge related
  to bioinformatics. Structured scientific databases, whether public or private, could
  be a critical enabler to identifying population-level trends. When combined with new
  advances in machine learning, the ability to glean powerful new insights could be
  significant. Only with such knowledge about the underlying biology—for instance, which
  genes cause which disease, condition, or even behavior—can we successfully engineer
  genes and build the infrastructure to scale bio innovations. In addition to enabling more
  scientific breakthroughs, enhanced access to data could lead to better reproducibility
  of research results, improved trust in science, and more innovation. These benefits need
  to be balanced against the costs, including the need to protect privacy and security and
  prevent malevolent uses. Accordingly, “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”
  is gradually replacing the “open-by-default” mantra associated with the early days
  of the open-access movement.169 However, enhanced access to data poses several
  outstanding policy challenges, from systems and processes to ensure transparency and
  foster trust across the research community and wider society to appropriate recognitions
  and rewards to encourage researchers to share data.

Commercialization and diffusion: Four factors play a role
Once an application is scientifically feasible, other factors will determine the journey from
lab to market to wide adoption and diffusion. Do the economics of a particular application
work or not? Is the supply chain supported by adequate infrastructure? Is there demand
among customers? How fast could the economics improve with new biologically based
production methods? The answers to these questions bear on whether companies or
governments are prepared to invest in innovation and develop an application to the point
where it is commercialized and scaled, and then adopted widely. In this section, we look at
the four factors applicable to these second and third stages of the journey from the lab to
market. None of them can be achieved as a one-off, but they must constantly be in play to
ensure that innovations keep moving along, diffusing more widely into different geographies,
and responding as the science, markets, competitive dynamics, and economies continue
to evolve.

     — Value propositions. However innovative the science is, new applications need to have
       a compelling value proposition. They must compete with existing products by providing
       improved utility, for instance through some combination of cost competitiveness, new
       insights, improved quality, and improved safety, or by offering a novel product that
       addresses unmet needs. Cost competitiveness may be only one of several dimensions
       that could make a new product or service enabled by biological advances attractive
       to potential users, but it is an important one. Many potential buyers of biology-based
       products are in industries with typically low margins, such as agriculture and energy.
       Moreover, once a method of production has existed for decades, years of efficiency
       gains have already been captured. Bio innovation, like other novel technologies, will need
       to overcome this head start to attract market demand even if applications have actual,
       theoretical, or eventual cost and quality advantages. Diffusion can take significant time,
       and costs can remain high for a considerable period. The first efforts to grow cultured
       proteins for space exploration began around the turn of the millennium.170 It took until 2013
       for humans to taste the first lab-grown hamburger, which was produced at a cost of more
       than $300,000.171 Since then, however, production costs have fallen dramatically with
       the development of processes that enable industrial-scale production. Cultured meat
       could hit supermarket shelves in the next ten years.

           In the case of biofuels, the price of oil is a critical determinant of whether they are viable,
           and although they may offer environmental advantages, biofuels have struggled to
           compete. Interest in aviation biofuels has been rising; many companies are active in this
           area. However, these fuels have not come close to replacing traditional fossil-fuel-based
           aviation fuel because of their production cost, which was between $1 and $2.50 per liter
           in 2019, compared with $0.30 to $0.60 per liter for traditional aviation fuel, according
           to the International Energy Agency.172 However, pricing in externalities (for example,
           the societal costs of net carbon emissions) could change the cost calculus—a significant
           driver of whether a technology is viable for investment and adoption.173

     — Business models. To best ensure that frontier biological technologies offer customers
       value, new business models may be needed. New business models may include new ways
       of monetizing data or establishing platform-based business models (see chapter 5 for
       further discussion). Platform models are proliferating in sectors such as agriculture.

     — Go to market. Once an innovative product or service has a compelling value proposition,
       an effective way of delivering it to end users is then needed. Key decisions must be
       made about, for instance, pricing, sales, and marketing. Arguably even more than in
       the case of traditional products and services, in the fast-moving innovative biological
       field, the imperative to continually refine and adapt strategy may be even stronger to
       respond to new competitors as they emerge and adapt as target markets become more
       competitive. In some cases, there has been considerable excitement about biology-based
       innovations—at-home genetic testing is an example. It is important for companies to avoid
       overhyping products (that may rest on incomplete or flawed science) only because they
       see early customer demand, lest the market collapses as the underlying assumptions are
       shown to be shaky. Some DTC testing companies in the past claimed to find associations

           Examples of policies addressing externalities include cap-and-trade schemes in the case of combating climate change.
           In such schemes, fuel suppliers must buy pollution permits (also called allowances) to cover their remaining carbon
           pollution. Cap-and-trade schemes create incentives to purchase cleaner products such as biofuels because the more
           fuel suppliers reduce their carbon pollution, the fewer allowances they need to buy.

      between genes and capabilities such as emotional control, memory, and athletic ability,
      but the science behind such associations is weak.174

— Operational scalability. Considerable effort is required to scale operations from
  individual laboratory experiments to industrial scale in order to serve a growing customer
  base. Several components of operational scalability, including infrastructure, processes,
  supply chain, and talent, have been and will continue to be crucial to commercializing and
  diffusing bio innovations.

      Infrastructure, processes, and supply chain need to be addressed to scale up.
      Infrastructure includes, for instance, the large-scale fermentation technology that was
      developed by pharmaceuticals and chemicals manufacturers to create large quantities
      of biological drugs and materials over the past half-century. This infrastructure should
      enable much more rapid scaling of next-generation fermentation-based technologies.
      The global market for fermented chemicals was estimated at $85 billion in 2017.175 A great
      deal of infrastructure is already in place, but more will be needed. It may seem obvious,
      but the components of modern healthcare delivery—hospitals, labs, outpatient centers,
      pharmacies, and so on—are crucial for the dissemination of medical innovations. For
      instance, CAR T‑cell therapy is extremely complex to administer and requires a hospital
      stay. The storage and movement of most gene and cell therapy products occur at ultra-low
      or cryogenic temperatures.176 CAR T‑cells are now being administered to growing number
      of patients in hospitals and treatment centers, meaning sufficient infrastructure for
      manufacturing and delivering these cells is necessary.177

      In addition, sufficient appropriate talent must be in place to drive commercialization of bio
      innovation. Just one example where the talent pool in healthcare is already under strain is
      genetic counselors, who help patients and the public understand and interpret the results
      of genetic tests and the trade-offs of subsequent decisions.178 These professionals are
      critical for the spread and successful adoption of genetic sequencing technologies.
      However, there are too few of them at a time when the amount of genetic information
      being generated is rising rapidly. More counselors are needed to keep pace with that
      explosion in data to ensure their responsible use in a consumer setting where there
      is no medical supervision.179 Broadly, this requires more education and training about
      the technologies and their applications.

Risk and mechanisms for governing use are relevant in all three stages
Given the profound and unique risks accompanying bio innovation, mechanisms governing
use, including broad acceptance by society and regulation, are key both in the first
research stage and when the science commercializes and diffuses. Even if an application is
scientifically feasible and well developed and the economics are favorable, end users and
other stakeholders—whether individuals, businesses, or healthcare systems—must want to
use innovative biology-based products and services, and in many cases that means accepting
some risk. Our research finds that about 70 percent of the total potential impact could hinge
on consumer, societal, and regulatory acceptance, based on an analysis of areas where
regulations exist today in major economies.180

      We examined existing regulations and their applicability to sized applications. Applications were also considered at stake
      if they relate to highly sensitive topics in academic circles, such as embryo editing and bioweapons. Our analysis is as of
      September 2019.

     The way technologies are seen and spoken about in the media, and by members of the public
     at large, will help determine the degree of societal acceptance, the reaction of regulators and
     legislators, and the behavior of companies trying to market or react to biological applications.
     For example, users must have a degree of trust to enable sequencing and analyzing a person’s
     genome, editing their children’s genes, or placing a biomachine interface device in a person’s
     brain. Major successes could capture the public imagination, and that might drive increased
     investment and a flow of talent to support further innovation. A biological disaster would likely
     have the opposite effect, causing a public backlash that could dampen investment, elicit
     a tough regulatory response, and hinder adoption.

     There is no uniformity in societal acceptance of bio innovations. Many of them, including
     genetic engineering of crops and, even more so, human beings, are perceived differently
     by different people in different cultures; what seems like an acceptable trade-off for
     some between scientific progress and risks may not be acceptable to others. Hence, bio
     innovations will need to gain societal acceptance if they are to be commercialized and prove
     successful in the marketplace. Citizens have considerable sway over regulators, and their
     views vary enormously, leading to a variety of regulatory approaches in different countries.
     It is already evident that innovation is geographically uneven, partly reflecting different
     regulatory approaches.

     The case of Golden Rice is illustrative.181 In 1982, scientists started developing vitamin A–
     fortified rice to combat vitamin A deficiency in poor regions. Although the first strain of
     the genetically engineered grain was produced in 2000, a general lack of support from
     the public and attempts to block regulatory approval by anti–genetic engineering activists
     have delayed commercialization for nearly two decades. In December 2019, the Philippines
     became the first country with many people suffering from vitamin A deficiency to approve
     Golden Rice. 182 The Philippine Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry said that it
     found Golden Rice to be as safe as conventional rice.183


     The pace and extent of adoption of bio innovations vary significantly
     depending on the application
     Applications will journey from the lab to commercialization and diffusion at different speeds;
     indeed, they already are doing so. Historical analogs suggest that the pace and extent of
     adoption at scale are highly variable. These adoption curves span domains and geographies
     to give a sense of the approximate average adoption timelines and spread in different
     circumstances (Exhibit 12).

     We used these analogs in our estimate of the timing of adoption as well as the shape of
     adoption curves (timing agnostic) for biological applications. We estimated low and high
     levels of peak adoption and the time it may take to reach peak adoption; we also modeled
     the adoption curves for each application. This simplification enables us to arrive at a feasible
     estimate of potential economic impact; we recognize that adoption levels may continue to
     increase with shifting product features and value propositions, changing cost structures of
     these applications and substitutes, and customer demographics.

                                     The pace and extent of adoption vary among applications within domains and among them
                                     (Exhibit 13). Some applications, such as using new bioroutes for drug manufacturing, are
                                     already showing strong signs of progress toward commercialization and adoption. Others,
                                     such as plant-based proteins, have recently become commercially viable; adoption is at
                                     an early stage but could increase rapidly over the coming decade. Still others, such as using
                                     genetically engineered plants to sequester CO2, show promise in the lab, but commercial
                                     viability and adoption by farmers or other buyers are likely to be further out; to commercialize,
                                     they need to demonstrate that beyond their carbon-capturing ability, they can compete
                                     on cost and yield with plants that are already established among other factors that need to
                                     be addressed.

Science is propelling innovation, but even when the applications of that science could have
benefits, there is no guarantee that innovation will be commercialized and adopted. Many
barriers stand in the way, and the journey from the lab to adoption may be long and arduous.
Nevertheless, the Bio Revolution appears to have reached an acceleration point, with about
400 applications in a wide range of domains scientifically conceivable. Most of these are
already scientifically feasible and many are moving toward commercialization, promising
impact even in the relatively near term of the next ten to 20 years. Beyond that point,
the impact is expected to radiate outward to almost every sector, transforming society in
important ways and making our economies and human activity more sustainable.

5. Implications for
   stakeholders
  Given the breadth of change that likely lies ahead, innovators, businesses, governments,
  and individuals need to become literate in biological science in order to understand
  the fundamental shifts under way and seize the large potential benefits, but in a way that
  ensures that innovation is safe for citizens and society.

  The many uncertainties about how and when the numerous applications may spread through
  economies and societies might suggest that taking a wait-and-see approach could make
  sense. However, it could be far more beneficial to get ahead of the curve—or at least keep
  pace with it—and start calibrating a portfolio of clear-headed responses now. The imperative
  is to attempt to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and capturing the large
  potential benefits while at the same time giving serious attention to the many risks involved.
  The choices made today and in the years ahead will influence not only the path of bio
  innovation but also the size of its benefits for stakeholders and, beyond them, for economies,
  society, and the planet.


  Innovators have a key role to play in ensuring sufficient oversight of
  innovation as it develops
  The scientists and researchers pioneering biological breakthroughs in academic, public, and
  private labs, and the developers and innovators who turn feasible science into commercially
  viable products, are in the vanguard of bio innovation. They are the ones who need to push
  the envelope on the science—to innovate—but also are the ones who should identify risks
  associated with their work and raise them for broader discussion. Scientists govern their
  own research processes. Peer review is a powerful internal governing mechanism to ensure
  that research is accurate and well grounded. But scientists cannot operate in a vacuum; to
  an extent, they need to take into account the views of society in the research they propagate.
  The scientific community must play a consistent and effective oversight role, and it has
  a track record of doing so. As far back as 1975, prominent scientists, lawyers, and medical
  professionals gathered at the Asilomar Conference in California to draw up voluntary
  guidelines to ensure the safety of recombinant DNA technology.184

  Debate about the right balance between scientific endeavor and discovery and societal
  interests is ongoing. The case of a highly dangerous genetically engineered form of bird
  flu is a good example. In 2011, two separate teams in the United States wanted to publish
  the results of the research project, but the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity
  argued that the results in full would provide a road map for spreading the virus for hostile
  reasons. Eventually, the study results were released in full, but the episode highlighted
  difficult issues about how to handle “dual-use” bio innovations intended for the public
  good but arguably too easily misused.185 Scientists in other fields, such as nuclear physics
  and AI, are grappling with some analogous issues, and there could be room for cross-
  disciplinary collaboration.

     Businesses should consider how to take advantage of bio innovation,
     including adapting strategies
     The potential value of biological applications over the next two decades makes a compelling
     argument for business adoption. The scientific innovations in turn could drive a proliferation
     of new products and services, markets, and business models. Just as happened with digital,
     biological applications will bring a cohort of new competitors eager to take on incumbents.
     Applications in every domain have spillover effects on other sectors. This means businesses
     face potentially far-reaching shifts in value chains and profit pools.

     Spillover effects to upstream, downstream, and adjacent sectors
     Applications in one domain will often have impact and knock-on effects on a range of sectors.
     Take healthcare as an example. The large amount of data generated through omics and
     related technologies will need to be collected, stored, analyzed, and shared, suggesting
     a need for even more capacity in these areas and greater integration between information
     technologies such as AI, the management of big data, and the Internet of Things; all of this
     will involve IT players. Electronics industries will need to manufacture cutting-edge devices
     like sequencers, spectrograph machines, biosensors, and wearables. The lines are blurring
     between healthcare and consumer sectors, with many innovations in the former being
     adopted and adapted by the latter.

     In the case of applications in agriculture, aquaculture, and food, there will be spillover into
     food retailing, for instance. Numerous fast-food chains have announced deals with plant-
     based meat-substitute producers to offer vegetarian and vegan versions of popular menu
     items. Beyond Meats and Impossible Foods have worked with chains such as Burger King,
     Dunkin’, and Kentucky Fried Chicken over the past two years. Cultured meat may reach
     the high-end market over the next five years through specialty restaurants—settings where
     consumers are less price-sensitive.186 If bio innovations mean that products have longer
     shelf lives and that plants can be grown in different climates, restaurants and supermarkets
     may be able to offer wider choice to consumers. Logistics and transportation players may
     need to adjust to produce being kept fresh for longer even without being refrigerated, and
     to increased demand for alternative proteins. For example, Sysco, a leading global food-
     service-distribution company, launched the Sysco Simply platform in 2018. It is designed to
     enable customers to accommodate growing consumer demand for varied dietary and lifestyle
     choices, including plant-based meat substitutes.187 Crop insurance may be affected by new
     traits that result from genetically engineered production systems. For instance, premiums
     charged in drought programs could be reduced due to new drought-resistant traits in crops.
     Product liability insurance taken out by retailers and food chains may also be affected by
     advances in tracing food safety and origin. Clear Labs, for example, says its automated
     testing platform based on next-generation sequencing can eliminate foodborne illnesses and
     product recalls.188

     Applications in consumer markets could affect insurers. If new consumer products and
     services that guide behavior based on biological information lead to improved nutrition,
     fitness, and health outcomes, insurance providers could pay their customers to use them
     (similar to paying those insured for quitting smoking, losing weight, or taking other actions
     to improve their health). Workplace wellness programs could also adopt these innovations,
     enabling employers to lower premiums for those who comply.

Innovations in materials, chemicals, and energy could potentially spill over into numerous
sectors that use these products as inputs. In the case of materials, the consumer packaged
goods industry could look very different; for example, the materials used in many consumer
products could shift from plastic to bio-based plastic packaging as customers increasingly
demand packaging and products that are more sustainable. In apparel, fashion, and luxury,
new supply chains could emerge as production shifts to less natural-resource-heavy
production technologies that consumers may demand. For example, consumers may want to
purchase goods that are not made with leather for animal welfare and environmental reasons.
In the case of fuels, the production of new, more sustainable biofuels may require new
underlying technologies in, for instance, engine design.189 Biofuels have the potential to alter
the aerospace, travel, and logistics industries if aviation biofuel is scaled and commercialized,
and becomes more price competitive. If biodiesel is widely adopted for trucks and
transportation, demand from the logistics industry for petroleum may decrease. That said,
thus far, biofuels have struggled to be cost-competitive with traditional fuels.

Biomachine interfaces also have numerous potential uses across sectors. Transportation
and hospitality players may use neuroergonomics to improve travel comfort and
safety.190 Neuroergonomic headsets that are able to provide information on the stress
levels of consumers may be useful in research on customer experience and may inform
the development of new products that will improve comfort. In finance, futuristic biomachine
interfaces that augment human capabilities for quantitative analysis may greatly benefit
high-volume traders and financial analysts. If advanced surgically implanted brain-computer
interfaces are developed and adopted, it may well be that insurance policies will need to
adjust their pricing and offerings to consumers—bearing in mind that these devices may
reduce or raise risk. The defense industry is both upstream and downstream for other sectors.
What happens in the military will draw on innovations in other sectors from healthcare to
materials, but also influence and drive innovation in those sectors. Military medicine has
already driven change in civilian healthcare settings, two examples being trauma care and
treatment of PTSD.191

Shifting value chains
Biological applications could lead to changes in value chains, although these shifts will
not often be easy nor quick. In agriculture, rising demand for alternative proteins could
disrupt the value chain.192 Prior to distribution of meat (and seafood), animals are bred, fed,
slaughtered (fished), and processed. In contrast, the value chain for cultured meat and
seafood is significantly compressed, involving only live-tissue sampling and cultivation of
cells into meat, processes often performed by the same company (Exhibit 14). Moreover,
new players in alternative proteins are aiming to be both biotech startups and aspirational
consumer brands. This “lab-to-table” approach consolidates profit pools. In addition,
suppliers of inputs for production of alternative proteins might scale or emerge. For example,
some companies focus on supplying the hardware, cell lines, and small molecules that are
needed to grow meat in the lab.193 An equally transformative shift in value chains could happen
in materials as plant-based materials spread.




189
      Biodiesel made from plant material could hold promise as a more sustainable alternative to diesel from fossil fuels.
      However, the molecular makeup of these fuels means they boil at different temperatures than petrodiesel, and
      therefore they can only be used in specially designed engines. German scientists have found a way to transform
      plant-based chemicals into a biodiesel that meets the boiling characteristics required by the European Committee for
      Standardization. See Edd Gent, “Biofuel could work in regular diesel engines,” Scientific American, June 20, 2017.
190
      Neuroergonomics is a research field that investigates the human brain functions—perceptual, cognitive, and motor
      functions—in relation to behavioral performance in natural environments and everyday settings.

                                      The structure of healthcare systems could also be altered. New diagnostics and treatments
                                      are changing the way patient care is delivered, with implications for providers, including
                                      hospitals, clinics, and long-term-care facilities. First, there could be a shift in where care
                                      is delivered. A proliferation of point-of-care diagnostics such as gene sequencing for
                                      cystic fibrosis could decentralize care from the most advanced and specialized centers for
                                      diagnostics and treatments to local and accessible facilities for care. Personalized medicine
                                      could spread and be delivered in secondary centers. As biological applications shift from
                                      treating disease to curing or preventing it, there could be less acute care and more preventive
                                      primary care.

                                      Second, the way biological data are used could change. Data that make it easier to identify
                                      conditions and treatments earlier could enable a move from an inpatient to an outpatient
                                      setting or perhaps even to the home. Players that aggregate data and create centralized data
                                                          REPEATS
                                      repositories could appear. They could also share data with pharmaceutical companies to
                                      improve R&D. Some DTC testing startups are using R&D collaborations to move up the value
                                                          ES and Report
                                      chain and tap into the profit pools of the pharmaceutical industry. One DTC testing company
                                      that is moving in this direction is Viome, which has raised $25 million to conduct about 15

clinical research trials with a view to developing its own treatments.194 Another example is
AOBiome’s role in the development of microbiome drugs; the company launched a Phase 2
clinical trial for the treatment of hypertension and a Phase 2B trial for its treatment for acne
vulgaris.195 The use of cell and gene therapies often relies on companion diagnostics that
identify the right patients. The diagnostics value chain is still inefficient due to factors such as
potentially high costs and slow adoption by physicians.196 These factors can hinder access to
new therapies.197 It could be that pharmaceutical companies move to develop, manufacture, or
provide access to diagnostics to boost the utilization of therapies.


Companies will need to adapt their business strategies
Companies have a critical role to play in accelerating adoption by working with the scientific
community, focusing on scientific advances and technologies that are likely to have
the most impact, investing in them, partnering with innovative startups, reinventing their
own organizations where appropriate, and managing risks. There are a number of elements
to consider.

Adopt a portfolio-based approach toward investing in bio innovation given
the uncertainty and varied timing of adoption
Given the varied timing with which applications are moving from lab to market, a portfolio-
based approach—that is, looking at use cases that are likely to be adopted over different
time horizons—may make sense. In the immediate future, focusing on applications where
the science is already advanced, where there is a compelling economic case, and where they
can be adopted at scale would seem advisable. In parallel, businesses could pick a small
number of potentially high-impact applications where the science is not fully established,
and then work with researchers and specialized startups to push innovation forward
through experimentation.

Master the confluence of disciplines in bio innovation with the right mix of talent
and collaborations
New collaborations are sprouting up as companies move to capture the opportunities
of bio innovation, spurred by the cross-disciplinary nature of advances. As technologies
rapidly evolve, and biotech and AI converge, both larger incumbents and smaller, science-
based startups could struggle on their own to drive R&D and navigate commercialization.
“Barbell-shaped” ecosystems characterized by cross-sector networks in which many small,
science-based companies are balanced by a few large incumbents are emerging and driving
the commercialization of new biological technologies.

Small, science-based startups currently at the forefront of innovation are pushing
the boundaries of what is possible and what some incumbents might consider too risky to
do themselves. This is leading to a growing range of collaborations between new players
embracing the high risk and high rewards of science-based opportunities and incumbents
ready to invest in the unique biological capabilities of these newcomers. For example, to
capture the cost effectiveness and higher precision of the new gene-editing technology
CRISPR, established players in agriculture and pharma are among those setting up R&D
collaborations with CRISPR players, such as Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, and
Pairwise. Some incumbents, hedging their bets, are choosing to partner with multiple—and, at
times, competing—startups.

     From full-blown acquisitions to more agile and short-term collaborations, large incumbents
     are testing different partnership approaches with smaller, science-based startups. In some
     cases, large incumbents with extensive customer networks are well positioned to test and
     launch the new products produced by smaller players lacking an existing customer base. For
     instance, players such as Novozymes and Inari are striking up partnerships with established
     seed producers of various sizes that have long-standing relationships with farmers and
     growers to introduce omics-driven innovations. In other cases, opportunities emerge for
     deeper collaboration and investment to leverage the larger partner’s commercial expertise
     and navigate regulation and commercial-approval processes better. In the area of brain-
     computer interfaces, Facebook spent between $500 million and $1 billion in 2019 to acquire
     CTRL-labs, a tech startup that translates neural signals from muscles as inputs in software.198
     These varying relationships offer benefits for both players and are pivotal to the commercial
     success of many of the new biological technologies. As the boundaries of traditional
     biological industries and other sectors blur, understanding the growing role of barbell-shaped
     ecosystems in driving R&D and commercial opportunities will become a greater source of
     competitive advantage for both incumbents and new science-based startups.

     In addition to collaborations, businesses will also need to develop the right mix of talents
     with various biological capabilities. New specialty skills in fields such as genomics, molecular
     biology, biochemistry, and neuroscience will increasingly be in high demand. Indeed,
     the merging of digital skills with biological skills will be a potent combination.

     Platform-based business models in biology can seize cross-sector opportunities,
     reduce marginal costs, and drive combinatorial innovation by leveraging growing
     biological data
     Many of the world’s largest corporations favor platform-based business models—a
     centralized technology and data platform licensed to other players or for proprietary use—
     that enable them to seize cross-sector opportunities, reduce marginal costs, and mine large-
     scale data sources to drive combinatorial innovation. Such platforms are particularly relevant
     for R&D-intensive sectors. Now companies with growing sources of biological data, like their
     digital predecessors, are integrating automation and machine learning to accelerate the pace
     and variety of scientific discoveries. These platform-based models enable businesses to
     deliver a diverse set of advantages that were unthinkable even a few years ago.

     To understand the nature of opportunities offered by biological platforms opportunities,
     consider agriculture. Companies selling farming equipment, seeds, or agricultural chemicals
     are now developing or partnering to create software-based platforms that act as farm
     management systems.199 NRGene has a cloud-based breeding platform that can analyze
     genomic data to inform scientists and breeders which sequences offer beneficial traits.200
     The rise of sophisticated and extensive computer modeling with genetic and microbiome
     insights can supplement traditionally slow, sequential experimentation and open the door for
     these new platforms to compete.

     Beyond agriculture, platform players looking for speedier growth are expanding
     the accessibility and use of their platforms, allowing other companies—including potential
     competitors—to build products or services on top of their databases. For example, Ginkgo
     Bioworks recently announced the Ferment Consortium, giving spin-off companies full access
     to its genome-mining platform for cell programming.201

Gaining momentum and armed with “data flywheels” in which each new piece of data makes
collecting the next piece easier, platforms are becoming a growing source of competitive
advantage in the Bio Revolution. Incumbents will need to understand how these platforms
are evolving to identify where the most attractive opportunities lie. In the future, incumbents
might choose to take advantage of others’ platforms or consider creating their own platforms
to rapidly experiment and learn at scale.

Seize the opportunities for more personalized and precise offerings emerging from
the growth of biological data
Advanced personalization and precision, powered by a growing amount of biological data—
including genetic makeup and microbiome composition—is set to transform and, in many
cases, deepen relationships among customers, the products they use, and the companies
that make the products. While most of the hype around the Bio Revolution is around new
technologies such as CRISPR used to manipulate biological processes, our research
shows that applying insights derived from analyzing biological data accounts for more than
50 percent of the economic potential over the next ten years. Businesses today are already
planning on how to monetize the exabytes of genetic data collected each year. Some DNA-
and microbiome-testing companies are using proprietary databases to launch personalized
nutrition products and services as add-ons. New offerings include, for instance, subscription-
based meal plans and dietary supplements that claim to be tailored to customers based on
DNA- and microbiome-testing results. These new players, increasingly in competition with
consumer-goods, services, and marketing companies, will provide unique experiences and
points of differentiation.

In addition to personalization, growing biological data banks are increasingly providing new
opportunities for precision products and services as well in industries such as agriculture
and medicine. With an emerging understanding of the role of the microbiome, precision
agriculture is set to drive innovative farming solutions that improve operational efficiency and
economic output. For example, Trace Genomics interprets health and disease-risk indicators
by profiling the soil microbiome. These insights can help growers in choosing tailored seeds,
nutrients, and other inputs, adding to the tool kit for precision agriculture that also includes
satellite imaging and geospatial analysis.

Incumbents will be able to maintain or capture new value only if they look at the entire
ecosystems of their products and services and begin to understand how to use biologically
derived insights to outperform their competitors. This may come through personalized,
seamless experiences—such as precision medicine delivering the right drug for
the right therapy at the right time—or through precision products and services driving
operational efficiencies.

Innovate with new revenue models that can help accelerate diffusion
In consumer markets, companies are actively looking at new ways to monetize data. Despite
declining costs, companies currently offering one-off DTC genetic testing are likely recording
a loss on each test due to the high cost of acquiring customers because of the need to engage
in extensive marketing. However, companies engaged in DTC testing are increasingly finding
other ways to monetize the biological data they gather. Most DTC companies sell individuals’
genetic data to pharmaceutical companies for drug R&D. As noted, many DTC genetic testing
providers also sell data to incumbents in consumer markets that are increasingly interested
in mining this data to add a new layer of personalization. Another approach is helping to
generate sales leads from recommendations based on test results. For instance, ingredients
on the shopping lists generated by DNAfit’s MealPlanner or Habit’s app can be purchased
directly from online retailers mySupermarket.co.uk and Amazon Fresh, respectively.

     Subscription-based offerings to generate revenue are becoming more common in personal
     insights and in personalized products and services based on genome and microbiome
     profiles.202 These subscriptions provide companies with recurring, predictable revenues
     and help to lock in consumers. As whole genome sequencing gains in prominence and
     lends itself to subscriptions, many players are trying to settle on pricing and a marketing
     strategy.203 This is not straightforward, because whole genome sequencing involves complex
     information and many variants. This makes it difficult for consumers to distill insights and
     understand the value proposition compared with more narrowly focused single nucleotide
     polymorphism analyses.204


     Civil society, governments, and policy makers need to inform themselves
     about biological advances to provide thoughtful guidance
     Given the breadth of the potential changes from biological advances that we have outlined
     in this report, it will be incumbent on all leaders to inform themselves and keep abreast
     of the latest scientific and commercial developments. The twin goals will be to capture
     the potential rewards that biology can offer and, at the same time, to understand and address
     the risks posed by this ongoing wave of innovation. Choices made today and in the years
     ahead will influence not only the path of adoption, but also the size of the benefits for
     stakeholders and, beyond them, for economies, societies, and the planet.

     The profound risks that this wave raises have inevitably prompted discussion about
     the capacity of existing professional and regulatory mechanisms to govern these activities.
     The novelty of these applications also provides an opportunity to reflect more generally
     on the principles governing these innovations and demand a considered response and,
     potentially, new approaches.

     Governments can set a strategic direction for biology-based innovation that encourages and
     enables the scientific community and business leaders. In 2008, the US National Institutes
     of Health, National Science Foundation, and Department of Energy asked the National
     Research Council’s Board on Life Sciences to set up a committee to look at how the United
     States was positioned on biological research and how to build on it. 205 China and the United
     Kingdom have also invested in biology-based innovation as a priority, publishing formal
     strategies.206 The leader of China’s Basic Research Department said the country was seeking
     to position itself as a global leader in synthetic biology, motivated by a need to address
     the country’s public health, nutrition, and resource needs.

     Managing risks and mechanisms that govern the use of biological applications—including
     regulation, which often reflects societal opinion—will be vital. Many bio innovations—including
     genetic engineering of crops and, even more so, of human beings—are viewed with concern,
     discomfort, or sometimes outright hostility.

     In the next ten years, more than 50 percent of the total potential impact of the Bio Revolution
     could hinge on consumer, societal, and regulatory acceptance, based on an analysis of areas
     where regulations exist today in major economies.207 This rises to more than about 70 percent
     in the next ten to 20 years. Some higher-risk applications, for example adult gene therapy, will
     likely be more regulated and thus adopted later, whereas other applications such as microbial

skin-care products that are less risky and therefore relatively less regulated may have
an easier and faster path to adoption.

Given the level of risk and uncertainty, regulation is seldom straightforward and is likely to
be highly dependent on the context. Different societies with different value systems will
accept different levels of uncertainty and risk under different circumstances. One example is
genetically engineered crops.208 Public perception differs markedly from country to country
and can change over time. One cross-cultural survey showed that Italian and Japanese
consumers rate GMO-free as a more important characteristic than US consumers do.209
Another survey found that only 11.9 percent of Chinese consumers have a positive view of
genetically engineered food.210

In addition to public perception, regulation of genetically engineered crops also differs among
geographies. Leaders in the adoption of genetically engineered crops include, in order of
most land used for their production, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada.211 In
the EU, 19 out of 28 member states have voted to partially or fully ban the cultivation and sale
of genetically engineered food products.212 In Africa, genetically engineered food products are
legal in just a few countries. Both China and the EU have mandated the labeling of traditionally
genetically engineered food products since 1997 and 2002, respectively.213 In January 2020,
China issued “biosafety” certificates for the commercialization of domestic crops of GM
soybean and two types of corn after a ten-year halt.214 The United States followed suit in 2018,
requiring genetically engineered food products to be labeled “bioengineered.”215

For the second wave of genetically engineered crops whose genomes have been altered
with gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, the US FDA has declared that it will not
regulate the plants as long as the editing does not lead to foreign DNA in the plant.216 The US
Department of Agriculture views gene editing as the equivalent of traditional breeding of
plants—a genetically engineered plant without foreign genetic material is indistinguishable
from plants developed using traditional breeding methods. In contrast, a landmark European
court ruling made gene-edited crops subject to the same stringent regulations as other
GMOs.217 At the time of writing, the stance of regulators elsewhere remained to be seen.218

A second example of highly variable approaches to governing the use of particular biological
applications is preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) or diagnosis (PGD), a technique to help
identify genetic defects within embryos prior to preimplantation.219 As of late 2019, the United


208
      Starting in the 1990s, genetic engineering emerged commercially to improve the yields and productivity of plants beyond
      traditional breeding. There are two waves of innovations in genetic engineering organisms. In one, genetically modified
      (GM) crops involve transgenic modifications (using genes from non-plant organisms such as bacteria). The next began
      with the arrival of genetic editing technologies (for instance, CRISPR) which are now enabling highly specific and efficient
      cisgenic changes (using genes from sexually compatible plants) and intragenic changes (changing gene combinations
      and regulatory sequencing belonging to the recipient plant).

      CRISPR-based editing in plants does not introduce foreign DNA. To mutate a gene of interest in a plant, scientists first
      grow protoplasts—plant cells lacking a cell wall. They then introduce preassembled CRISPR complexes, including a
      tailor-made stretch of guide RNA and the nuclease Cas9, to the protoplasts. The complex homes in on the target gene
      and cuts the DNA at a locus specified by the guide RNA. Protoplasts are then grown in clumps that are regenerated into a
      mature, genetically modified plant.

      Preimplantation genetic testing is genetic testing of an embryo prior to embryo transfer (to a uterus) during IVF. This
      can be done to test for single gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis (preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD) or
      overall chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome caused by an extra chromosome (preimplantation genetic
      screening, or PGS).

     States had few restrictions. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine largely leaves
     individual clinics and parents to decide what is permissible.220 The procedure can be used
     in the United States for any condition for which genetic testing is available. Although it is
     primarily used to detect serious heritable disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, it can also be used
     for more controversial purposes, such as sex selection. In contrast, the Human Fertilisation
     & Embryology Authority in the United Kingdom tightly regulates the procedure, permits
     its use for medical purposes only, and maintains a detailed list of disorders for which it is
     permitted.221 In China, the procedure is permitted only for detection of serious diseases—not
     for sex selection—and its use has taken off since the government explicitly made this form of
     screening a priority.222

     Differences in approach are also evident with the sharing of genomic data. The United States
     treats genomic data in the same way as health data under the Health Insurance Portability
     and Accountability Act of 1996. The EU tightly guards omics data with special provisions
     under its General Data Protection Regulation. China has rules governing sharing of omics
     data and imposes restrictions on data leaving the country, reflecting a broad stance in favor
     of controlling the flow of genomic data out of China. At the same time, there is concern about
     China acquiring data from outside the country for use by its scientists and companies.223

     Regulation to an extent reflects public opinion. It also reflects government views of the public
     interest, including economic competitiveness. Lighter-touch regulation may deliver—or
     be seen to deliver—competitive advantage compared with a more restrictive approach.
     A regulatory “race” could put pressure on the more cautious to adopt more laissez-faire
     approaches, potentially exposing them to increased risks. Each jurisdiction will need to
     grapple with the interaction of regulation and innovation.

     While value systems and regulations vary from country to country, national responses to bio
     innovations will be limited, because biology doesn’t respect borders—as we are experiencing
     firsthand with COVID‑19. A coordinated international response would not only be more
     beneficial for managing risk, but would also help countries propel collaborative innovation.


     Individuals and consumers may be pivotal to the adoption path of
     biological advances
     Individuals, as consumers, play a large role in assessing the value of innovations, influencing
     public discourse and shaping adoption. Individuals must understand the various trade-offs
     of new applications that generate new insights, become knowledgeable about the scientific
     advances and their risks, and proactively engage in public dialogue and policy making.

     Consumers may not always be fully aware of the potential impact of biological applications
     on their privacy, for instance. DTC testing is one example, as discussed in chapter 3. Many
     individuals were unaware that their data were being shared by third parties. Individuals also
     need to be aware that the science behind a consumer application of biology may not always
     be solid. Again in the case of DTC testing, one analysis found that 40 percent of variants
     in a variety of genes reported in DTC raw data were false positives; retesting in a clinical
     laboratory showed that the variant was not actually present. 224 Some variants designated
     as being “increased risk” in DTC raw data or by a third-party interpretation service were
     classified as benign by clinical laboratories.225 It may be that individuals should push for more

           In 2017, estimates suggested that preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) was performed more often and growing five
           times faster in China than in the United States. The popularity of this procedure owes much to the fact that diseases with
           a genetic source carry a heavy stigma in China. See David Cyranoski, “China’s embrace of embryo selection raises thorny
           questions,” Nature, August 16, 2017.

information before taking a test, and it is possible that DTC companies should provide genetic
counseling. France and Germany ban DTC genetic testing altogether due to requirements that
call for medical or some other type of informed supervision and genetic counseling.

Beyond ensuring that they protect their privacy and inform themselves to avoid misselling,
individuals can have a powerful voice in determining the stance of regulators, as we have
seen in the case of genetically engineered crops and, even more so, the prospect of genetic
engineering of human beings.




The rapid advances in biology in recent years amount to a powerful new wave of innovation
that is expected to transform business and society. Healthcare is already seeing growing
adoption of biological applications, and many other sectors are also being affected.
The traditional journey of protein from farm to plate may be replaced with a path that starts
in a lab. Novel materials produced with a reduced carbon footprint can conserve the natural
resources we currently use in manufacturing. There are massive opportunities for businesses
to create more value for customers and shareholders. For all the excitement about bio
innovation, the path ahead is fraught with risks and serious ethical issues. Scientists and
regulators will need to work together to ensure that these innovations do not cross ethical
boundaries and to assuage public concerns even while giving science the room to explore
new directions. Biology has no borders any more than climate change does; the case for
cooperation as well as competition is compelling if this wave of innovation is to proceed—and
proceed safely—for the benefit of all.

6. Applying bio
   innovation
  As noted earlier in this report, we group bio innovations into four arenas—biomolecules,
  biosystems, biomachine interfaces, and biocomputing. Here we dig deeper into the library
  of use cases and discuss applications of evolving biological science in key domains, from
  healthcare and agriculture to consumer products, energy, and the environment. Applications
  have different adoption horizons and present a wide range of opportunities, risks, and
  challenges. The use cases we spotlight are by no means exhaustive; these applications
  merely constitute the visible pipeline that we were able to examine in depth. Many other
  applications will surface in coming years. Overall, the breadth of uses and potential uses
  is a testament to just how powerful and wide-ranging the potential for biological sciences
  could be for business, the economy, and society more broadly. In the following sections of
  chapter 6, we discuss a wide range of use cases that could have direct impact in the next ten
  to 20 years, but also applications that have potential impact further out. We start by exploring
  biomolecules and biosystems innovations across domains, and then explore innovations in
  biomachine interfaces and biocomputing.

                                     The range of technologies being used in healthcare today is taking off, creating a steep
                                     innovation curve (Exhibit 15). Conventional therapies, including small molecules,
                                     nonrecombinant vaccines, and natural extracts constituted a first wave of pharmaceutical
                                     innovation. A second wave included protein-based biologics such as peptides and
                                     monoclonal antibodies.226 Today, a third wave is under way that includes new approaches such
                                     as cell, gene, and RNA therapies. In this section, we discuss a broad range of biomolecules
                                     and biosystems innovations to improve human health and performance. There are also
                                     advances in biomachine interfaces that improve human health and performance, as discussed
                                     in chapter 6.6.

                                           We consider these out of scope for this research, as they are part of previous waves of pharmaceutical innovation. As

                                           proteins are frequently called “biologics.” Monoclonal antibodies are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of

                                      The pace of adoption will vary (Exhibit 16). Adoption of the full range of gene therapies
                                      could be relatively slow unless costs come down because of competition or new financing
                                      models. Overall, gene therapies for monogenic diseases are likely to be adopted earlier than
                                      those for polygenic diseases, which are more complex. Even among polygenic diseases,
                                      the path to adoption varies. CAR T‑cell therapy for certain cancers is already showing signs
                                      of commercial viability and enthusiastic adoption. By contrast, research into understanding
                                      the underlying pathogeneses of neurodegenerative diseases is still at a very early stage, and
                                      effective treatments have yet to be discovered.227

                                      In the next ten to 20 years, we estimate that the use of biomolecules and biosystems
                                      innovations in healthcare could potentially have annual direct impact of $500 billion to
                                      $1.2 trillion globally, which is 33 percent of the total direct impact from our library of around
                                      400 use cases. This impact comes from improvements in human health and performance,
                                      mostly measured as a reduction in the global burden of disease translated into workforce
                                      productivity (Exhibit 17). In terms of disability-adjusted life years, this equates to between 1
                                      and 3 percent of the total global burden of disease.228

                                            It measures the number of years lost to ill health, disability, or early death.

     Much of the impact in the short term will likely come from applications that deliver
     personalization and precision, because relevant technologies are already relatively
     mature. Precision medicine in stem cell therapies, for instance, has been developing since
     the 1980s; today, tailoring of treatment is spreading.229 Another enabling capability relevant in
     healthcare—and one likely to have impact over time—is accelerating research (for instance,
     libraries that identify which genes cause which diseases).

     Biological applications in healthcare could potentially affect every disease. A great deal
     of research is under way not only in genomics, which is most advanced, but in other omics
     such as epigenomics and proteomics in a broad-based search for new ways to prevent,
     diagnose, and treat disease and mitigate the health impact of aging. As scientists gain ever
     more detailed understanding of the molecular pathways of a disease, one can easily imagine
     a future in which the full range of omics is used in all clinical areas. A new era of regenerative
     medicine and novel approaches to aging is arriving rapidly. The sections that follow focus on
     four areas: public health; optimizing health and traits in future generations; the prevention,
     diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and aging-related damage; and improving
     the development and delivery of drugs.


     Omics could have a substantial positive impact on public health through
     the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases
     Infectious diseases account for 20 percent of the global disease burden.230 In this section, we
     cover public health measures that reduce their spread.

     Gene drives to reduce vector-borne diseases
     An estimated 700,000 deaths globally every year are the result of vector-borne infectious
     diseases.231 Until recently, controlling these infectious diseases by altering the genomes of
     the entire population of the vectors was considered difficult because the vectors reproduce
     in the wild and lose any genetic alteration within a few generations. However, with the advent
     of CRISPR, gene drives with close to 100 percent probability of transmission are within
     reach. This would offer a permanent solution to preventing most vector-borne diseases,
     including malaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and Lyme disease. Work has already been
     carried out to genetically engineer mosquitoes so that they can fend off parasites that cause
     malaria in humans, but until 2014, researchers hadn’t found a way to ensure that the pertinent
     genes would spread rapidly through the wild population, which gene drives can do. Making
     conservative assumptions about adoption, the estimated annual direct impact from gene
     drives could be between roughly $5 billion and $10 billion in the next ten to 20 years,
     reflecting the potential of these approaches to address a large portion of today’s global
     disease burden. For now, the promise of gene drives has yet to materialize, and considerable
     risks must be managed if the drives are to be deployed responsibly, as discussed in chapter 3
     of this report.232 The National Academy of Sciences has warned that “considerable gaps in
     knowledge” remain about gene drives’ ecological and evolutionary effects.233

           A vector is an organism that does not cause a disease but spreads the infection from one host to another; one example is
           the female anopheles mosquito, which transmits malaria. See Vector-borne diseases, World Health Organization.

DNA sequencing of pathogens to detect outbreaks
Genomics-related diagnostics can help to isolate pathogens and mutated strains quickly,
which is highly valuable in the case of pandemics or the rapid emergence of new diseases,
particularly outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections.234 Since the first bacterial genomic
sequencing in 1995, inexpensive, ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing technology has
developed and turned what had been an expensive public health exercise into a routine one.235
Apart from epidemiological investigation, these diagnostics can also identify the antimicrobial
susceptibility of the pathogens and therefore help clinicians to administer the right
antimicrobials quickly. We estimated that the direct annual economic impact of pathogen
sequencing may range from about $2 billion to $4 billion.

Many companies, including Illumina, Thermo Fisher, and BGI Genomics already offer DNA
sequencing for pathogens. Further, DNA biosensors that can detect pathogenic DNA in
the environment—in food, water, and air—have been available since 2002 but have not yet
been widely adopted.236

At the time of publication, the world is struggling to contain a new coronavirus that causes
COVID‑19. The outbreak serves to emphasize the global threat of diseases. It also, however,
illustrates the advances that have been made in the scientific ability to understand and
deconstruct such pathogens. Chinese scientists sequenced the virus’s genome and made
it available on the internet on January 10, weeks after the first report of pneumonia from
an unknown virus was reported in Wuhan. Labs all over the world started working on
developing diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.237


Optimizing health and traits in future generations is possible but fraught
with controversy
The ultimate prevention strategy for most genetic disorders is to detect and avert them before
individuals are born. There is tremendous potential here, but also significant ethical concerns.
The total direct annual impact of all omic and molecular technologies used in screening and
intervention could range from roughly $25 billion to $50 billion in the next ten to 20 years.

There are three stages to the reproductive journey during which omics-based screening
and intervention techniques play an important role: preconception planning, conception,
and pregnancy. In the first area, carrier screening is a genetic test performed on individuals
thinking of starting a family to determine if they are carriers of recessive diseases. In the past,
carrier screening was available for only a small number of diseases, including Tay-Sachs and
cystic fibrosis.

In the second stage—conception—prospective parents who are identified as carriers of
certain genetic diseases can opt to use advanced reproductive technologies such as in vitro
fertilization (IVF) with embryo screening and selection or, in the distant future, even embryo
editing to prevent disorders.238 Currently IVF can be used to screen for conditions like Down
syndrome or cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder), but could be used in the future for selection
based on the relative risk of developing a polygenic condition such as diabetes.239 It is also

      now scientifically feasible—but highly controversial—to edit embryos, for instance by using
      CRISPR. For example, in November 2018, a Chinese scientist made headlines by claiming
      to have edited human embryos to protect against HIV. 240 He was prosecuted by the Chinese
      government in 2019 for “illegal medical practices” and sentenced to three years in prison.241
      Other potential nonmedical uses of these technologies—for instance, to influence traits such
      as hair texture—could push into even more ethically challenging territory.

      In the third phase are pregnancy, omics-based noninvasive prenatal testing.242 Such testing
      largely diagnoses chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome from the genetic
      material of unborn babies in the maternal blood, but could be used in the future to diagnose
      monogenic disorders.


      Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and aging-related
      damage will likely have the most economic impact
      The largest potential direct economic impact in healthcare is likely to come from preventing,
      diagnosing, and treating diseases, according to our analysis. That impact could total between
      $500 billion and $1.2 trillion a year over the next ten to 20 years, spread across multiple
      disease areas (Exhibit 18). The majority of the potential impact comes from the prevention,
      diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and aging-related damage to
      health.243 Many uncertainties surround the development of technology and the price of
      innovative new medicines and treatments, and therefore access to them for patients.

      Personalized medicine may become a reality in all aspects of disease management. The risk
      of diseases linked to specific genes can now be predicted by testing the genomics of
      individuals. Clinical diagnostic tests to segment diseases have been developed based on
      omics, one example being HER2 protein testing for breast cancer, conducted in the tumor
      directly.244 New treatments are being developed, some of which have been approved.245
      Microbiomics—the study of microbes living in the gut, skin, and other areas of the body—also
      can be of diagnostic and therapeutic value.246 Numerous startups, including Kallyope and
      Dermbiont, are researching applications of microbiomics in the cutaneous, gastrointestinal,
      and reproductive tracts.247

      Monogenic diseases
      An estimated 10,000 diseases affecting human beings originate from a single gene.248
      Diagnosis and treatment of these diseases is limited today by insufficient access to effective
      diagnostics and treatments even in cases where scientists and physicians know the precise
      genetic cause of the disease. Diagnostic tests for certain monogenic disorders have been
      available for some time. For instance, the blood test that confirms the presence of sickle
      cell disease was developed in 1955.249 However, rapid and accurate diagnosis of all known
      monogenic disorders has become available over the past decade only because of advances in
      large-scale parallel DNA sequencing.250

      Our assessment focuses on gene therapy cures that could have the greatest direct annual
      impact. At the time of writing, approved gene therapies exist for beta thalassemia and spinal
      muscular atrophy, and now trials are under way for therapies to treat other monogenic
      diseases, including sickle cell anemia.251 Other diseases that can currently be treated by
      gene therapies include blood disorders like hemophilia and rare diseases such as inherited
      blindness and immune deficiencies. The availability of these therapies will reinforce screening
      for these disorders. Adoption of the therapies should be relatively high in high-income
      countries given a lack of alternative treatments and the devastating nature of the diseases.
      Despite expected high adoption, the overall impact is likely to be smaller than for other
      diseases because monogenic diseases are relatively rare.

      Cancer
      Cancer represents 9 percent of the global burden of disease and, in 2017, accounted for
      one in six premature deaths.252 The genetic basis of cancer has been studied for at least
      two decades; the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations associated with breast cancer were first
      discovered in the early 1990s, for example.253 Today, applications based on omics and
      molecular technologies are increasingly effective for all stages of cancer management,
      screening, diagnosis, staging, categorization, treatment, monitoring, and cure. The total direct
      impact from a range of technologies that we studied could range from about $400 million to
      about $870 million a year globally in the next ten to 20 years.

      For decades, the primary treatments for cancer were surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation
      therapy. Over the past 20 years or so, drugs that target cancer cells by homing in on particular
      molecular changes within the tumor became standard treatments. Now, a range of gene and
      cell therapies are being developed for cancer. The cellular therapies apply to a diverse group
      of cells in the immune system, including T‑cells (to which CAR T‑cell therapies apply, as we
      discuss below), natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and other lymphocytes in the innate and
      adaptive immune system.254

      Research currently focuses on a number of areas, including genetically engineered viruses
      that target and kill cancer cells, gene transfer to alter the functioning of and thereby kill
      cancer cells, and cellular immunotherapy such as cancer vaccines that enhance the ability of
      the body’s own immune system not only to find and kill cancers, but also protect against their

            Natural killer cells are a type of lymphocyte (a white blood cell) and part of the immune system; they play a major role
            in host rejection of both tumors and virally infected cells. Dendritic cells are another type of lymphocyte; they process
            antigen material. See Sonia Guedan, Marco Ruella, and Carl H. June, “Emerging cellular therapies for cancer,” Annual

development in the first place.255 That last approach is called adoptive cell transfer. The most
clinically developed of the several kinds of adoptive cell transfer is chimeric antigen receptor
T‑cell or CAR T‑cell therapy, which has grown substantially more than the others.256 In CAR
T‑cell therapy, a patient’s T‑cells are taken from the blood, modified in the lab so that they will
attack cancer cells, and then reinjected into the patient.257

CAR T‑cell therapy is currently limited to patients with specific types of blood cancers who
have not responded to other treatments; both safety considerations and affordability are
holding back wider adoption.258 In the future, use may move upstream (to patients whose
disease is in earlier stages) as costs come down and safety improves.

Identification of biomarkers also facilitates early diagnosis and targeted therapy of cancers
through liquid biopsies.259 There is considerable investment in this approach because of its
potential to estimate the size of tumors, select the right treatment, monitor the progress of
that treatment, and detect recurrence—all using a simple blood test instead of conventional
tumor tissue biopsies.260

Finally, new treatments for solid cell cancers are emerging, with targeted therapies,
checkpoint inhibitors, and other approaches such as oncolytic viruses.261 Some companies,
including Moderna, for instance, are creating individualized therapeutic vaccines for cancer.
Each tailored vaccine encodes protein-containing mutations that are unique to a patient’s
tumor. Once injected into the patient, the vaccine has the potential to help the patient’s
immune system better recognize cancer cells as foreign and destroy them.262 Such
technologies are key pillars of precision or personalized medicine that increase efficacy and
reduce toxicity.

Other polygenic diseases
Most diseases have a polygenic component, and applications of omics and related
biomolecular techniques are helping in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, metabolic, reproductive, and other
diseases. These conditions impose a heavy disease burden. New applications could take
a long time to materialize and have lower adoption than treatments for monogenic diseases
and cancer.

Genome-wide association studies or GWAS are furthering our understanding of the link
between genes and disease pathways.263 Identification of genes—for instance, PCSK9 for
cholesterol metabolism—can lead to targeting by inhibitors, siRNAs, or genome editing.264
Polygenic risk scoring can quantify the probability of the onset of diseases such as type 2
diabetes, and intervention can then be staged to prevent the disease from developing.265

      Omics-based biomarkers can be used to predict and monitor conditions such as glaucoma.266
      Startups, including, for example, Mirvie, are introducing blood tests that measure placental
      gene expression (number of RNA molecules transcribed from DNA) in the maternal blood to
      predict preterm births.267

      Finally, understanding the pathways of disease development can help identify genes to
      be targeted to cure or mitigate chronic diseases. Startups such as Verve Therapeutics are
      exploring targets for gene therapies to treat heart disease.268 Several companies, including
      Axovant and Voyager Therapeutics, are conducting clinical trials of gene therapies for treating
      neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s and metabolic disorders such as OTC (an
      enzyme) deficiency.269 Cell therapies involving CAR T‑cells are also promising in the treatment
      of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis.270 Randomized controlled trials are under
      way to ascertain the benefits of universal newborn genomic sequencing that can be included
      in each baby’s medical record.

      Infectious diseases
      Genetics influences infectious diseases in different ways, including susceptibility, pathogen
      identification, and treatments. For instance, having two copies of the CCR5 mutation confers
      resistance to HIV infection. Genomic data from patients can indicate increased risk for
      infectious diseases and help in early detection and prevention.271

      On identifying pathogens, next-generation sequencing offered by several companies—
      Karius is one example—can be used to sequence and identify more than 1,000 pathogens,
      including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, using blood plasma, and report the results in
      a day.272 Quick diagnosis can enable targeted treatment and prevent adverse drug reactions.273
      Gene sequencing of pathogens is already predicting antibiotic resistance and helping to
      guide treatment.

      Finally, new treatment methods are being developed for infectious diseases, including, for
      instance, gene therapy to treat HIV, which is now in clinical trials.274 CRISPR can be used
      as an “antibiotic” for killing pathogens directly or through modified phages (also known as
      bacteriophages, these are viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria).275 siRNA therapies
      are in clinical trials to treat viral diseases such as hepatitis B.276 Another exciting application
      is the development of DNA-based and mRNA-based vaccines by companies like Curevac
      and GSK.277

Regenerative medicine
Regenerative medicine is a branch of tissue engineering and molecular biology. It refers to
replacing, engineering, or regenerating human or animal cells, tissues, or organs to restore or
establish natural function. Omics and molecular technologies are producing breakthroughs
in this area. They hold promise for treatments that do not exist today, including for patients
living with spinal cord injuries, needing organ transplant, or suffering from a range of issues
from organ dysfunction to baldness. In the United States alone, there are nearly 18,000 spinal
cord injuries every year, and more than 360,000 individuals living with great difficulty with
the consequences.278 The worldwide shortage of organs needed for transplants is significant.
Another name is added to the transplant list every ten minutes in the United States, and, on
average, 20 people die every day because of a lack of available organs.279 In all of these cases,
stem cells or acellular materials could stimulate growth or repair of such organs, as well as
mitigate the immune reaction to transplantation.280

The largest advances have been in using stem cells in regenerative medicine. Stem cells have
been applied, for instance, to spinal cord injuries, alopecia, and Crohn’s disease. Some stem
cell treatments secrete factors that stimulate growth or reduce immune reaction. Others
grow replacement tissues. A few stem cell treatments such as bone marrow transplants for
treating leukemia are well established. Conventional stem cells were derived from embryos,
but more recently it has become possible to generate pluripotent (able to produce several
biological responses) stem cells from adult cells. The majority of treatments to replace tissue
are more novel. There have been some successes, including, for instance, growing skin for
burn patients. Applications for more complex constructs such as whole, transplantable organs
are on the horizon. Some initial experiments have even suggested the ability to combine
3-D-printing technologies to “print” cells into organ structures in the future (although such
an application will require many more years of development).281

Repair of damaged tissue can also be accomplished without the use of stem cells by
stimulating growth using acellular materials such as inserted scaffolds. These are
composed of collagen molecules that simulate restorative cell growth in the dura mater
(known as dural repair patches), a thick membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
Emerging technologies also offer interesting potential for containing immune reactions to
transplantation procedures themselves, including allogeneic cell therapies for controlling
graft-versus-host disease and new immuno-monitoring tools.

Aging
A new field of biomedical research—geroscience—is emerging to study how molecular aging
leads to disease, and to use that knowledge to slow the rate of aging and to reverse its effects
such as genomic instability, telomere attrition (telomere ends of chromosomes get shorter as
cells divide, a sign of aging), and epigenetic alterations.282

While geroscience includes technologies such as calorie restriction and exercise that
are beyond the scope of this report, we examined virtually all omics, including genomics,
epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, that are used to study aging.283 Epigenomics
in particular has emerged as a powerful tool in tracking biomarkers to measure the process.284
On the therapy side, innovative anti-aging therapies such as stem cell and gene therapies are
being developed and tested. Stem cells may potentially regenerate and repair tissues and

      organs by replacing damaged or dead cells with healthy ones.285 Thus far, no approaches have
      been approved that lengthen healthy life spans and restore or maintain cognitive and physical
      functionality.286 Companies working on stem cell and organ replacement for anti-aging
      purposes include Alkahest, Longeveron, and Rejuvenate Bio.

      Significant hurdles to the discovery of effective anti-aging therapies remain. One major
      challenge is that studies in humans using life span as a clinical endpoint take years if not
      decades to complete. Some work has been started to search for, and validate, “surrogate
      endpoints” for aging that would be acceptable to regulatory agencies; they could be tests of
      muscle strength or circulating cytokines (small proteins used in cell signaling).287 In addition,
      various risks may be associated with anti-aging treatments, which can carry both benefits
      and drawbacks. Reversing the damage resulting from aging may increase the risk of cancer,
      for instance.288

      Guided care
      A person’s genes affect how his or her body responds to medication. For example, proteins in
      the liver chemically alter drugs, and these changes can make the drugs more or less active in
      the body and can influence side effects. Even small differences in the genes of these proteins
      can have a big impact on a drug’s safety or effectiveness. In the long term, it may be possible
      for doctors to select the drugs and doses best suited for each person using an individual’s
      genomic profile, an approach called pharmacogenomics.289 Doing so is especially important
      with diseases like cancers and psychiatric disorders, for which treatments are associated with
      a high incidence of adverse drug reaction. After the approval of the first pharmacogenomic
      test in 2004, several startups, such as Color Genomics, Oneome, and Genelex, began offering
      lab-developed tests to consumers.

      In addition to pharmacogenomics, omics analyses can help reveal key mechanisms in
      disease development, treatment resistance, and recurrence risk, and can guide treatment
      decisions.290 For example, studies have revealed characteristic gene expression (mRNA
      and proteins) patterns that can predict disease progression and treatment response for
      patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, and non-small-cell
      lung cancer.291

      Other aids that can help to guide clinical care decisions, whose impact we do not estimate,
      include biosensors that can detect the presence of a biomarker (for example, reengineered
      skin patches can be used as biosensors to detect sugar levels) and guide treatment.292

Omics and molecular technologies can play an important role in
improving the development and delivery of drugs
Omics and molecular technologies can help in the identification of new molecular pathways
and targets for new drug molecules, in selecting patients for clinical trials, in drug repurposing
and reconditioning, and in the creation of experimental and predictive models for human
health and disease. New technologies can play a significant role in reducing the time and cost
of drug development and testing. “Organs on a chip”—microfluidic devices lined with living
human cells that replicate the architecture and functions of living human organs—are one
example.293 Combined with omics and molecular technologies data, these devices could be
a high-throughput alternative to traditional animal testing for drug development and disease
modeling. Improved predictive models could reduce R&D costs by more than 10 percent
by improving success rates and making R&D more cost-effective. They could also narrow
the gap between preclinical testing and human trials.

Today, the productivity of R&D is unsustainably low. The estimated average cost of bringing
a drug to market (including drug failures) is now $2.6 billion, a 140 percent increase over ten
years ago. Only about 12 percent of novel drugs entering clinical trials will successfully reach
the market.294 Support from genomics could raise the cumulative probability of success from
Phase 1 trials to regulatory approval from approximately 11 to 28 percent and reduce the cost
of developing a new drug by about 50 percent.295 Selecting for patients more likely to respond
to a drug reduces the necessary size of trials and therefore their cost. The total estimated
annual global direct impact of all the technologies described could be between roughly
$15 billion and $25 billion over the next ten to 20 years.

6.2. Agriculture, aquaculture,
     and food
    Humans have been growing crops and raising animals for thousands of years using
    a constantly evolving set of technologies, tools, and techniques. Since the dawn of agriculture,
    humans have used techniques like selective breeding to develop certain traits.296 Recent
    biological advances build on this long history, giving us new tools to use in our food systems
    that could enable a leap to entirely new business models and value chains, shift methods of
    production, and introduce new forms of genetic variation. In this section, we discuss a range
    of biomolecules and biosystems innovations in agriculture, aquaculture, and food

    In the 1990s, genetic engineering emerged commercially to improve the traits of plants (such
    as yields and input productivity) beyond traditional breeding.297 Historically, the first wave
    of genetically engineered crops have been referred to as genetically modified organisms
    (GMOs), or organisms with foreign (transgenic) genetic material introduced.298 Now, recent
    advances in genetic engineering (such as emergence of gene editing tools like CRISPR) have
    enabled highly specific cisgenic changes (using genes from sexually compatible plants) and
    intragenic changes (altering gene combinations and regulatory sequencings belonging to
    the recipient plant).299

    With the global population is expected to grow by roughly two billion by 2050, and more than
    820 million people do not have enough to eat, continuing innovation is vital if we are to feed
    the world—and do so sustainably. 300 Food production puts a huge strain on the sustainability
    of natural resources. For example, raising animals for meat, eggs, and milk generates
    14.5 percent of GHG emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO). 301

    Biological sciences could help meet these challenges in a number of ways, including marker-
    assisted breeding, genetic engineering, application of insights from microbiome sequencing,
    and modification of the microbiome through new treatments. 302 In addition, there is potential
    in developing alternative proteins and using omics to improve food safety approaches.
    The timing of adoption will vary (Exhibit 19). Genetic editing through CRISPR is being applied
    to food, although this process is still at a relatively early stage. Novel plant-based protein
    has already been commercialized. In the United States, plant-based protein sales grew by
    14 percent in 2019 versus the previous year, hitting $1 billion; in comparison, meat sales
    were virtually stagnant at growth of 0.8 percent. 303 Lab-grown meat is at an earlier stage; its
    science and production are more complex, and it remains expensive compared with traditional
    meat from animals.

                                      Three types of bio innovation could transform farming
                                      In agriculture and aquaculture, we highlight three areas: marker-assisted breeding, genetic
                                      engineering, and the microbiome.

                                      Marker-assisted breeding
                                      Selective breeding of animals and plants is well established. In the case of plants,
                                      the semidwarf characteristic was developed first for wheat in Mexico from the mid-1940s to
                                      1950s, and it now accounts for 99 percent of global wheat acreage. Among its advantages
                                      over normal wheat are that the stalks are shorter and stronger (and less likely to bend over in
                                      the wind, leaving the ear on the ground where it will spoil), that it takes less time to produce
                                      grain, and that it can be harvested by heavy machinery. 305 The semidwarf characteristic was
                                      subsequently bred into several types of modern rice, leading to high-yield varieties. More is
                                      to come. For example, Bayer has developed a hybrid dwarf maize variety called short stature

      corn that is biofortified with increased beta-carotene; the company says it will demonstrate
      the product to growers over the next two to three years. 306

      Traditional selective breeding used visible or measurable traits, or phenotypes—an approach
      that was slow and costly. Now marker-assisted breeding, which identifies genes using genetic
      markers, is coming to the fore; this technique is multiple times faster than old-style selective
      breeding. In the past, developing new varieties of crops could take 25 years, but marker-
      assisted selective breeding has cut that down to seven to ten years at the same time that it
      makes selection more efficient, achieving more precision and lowering costs. 307

      Advances have been built on the back of radical reductions in the cost of DNA sequencing.
      Tools like high-throughput microarrays have enabled the detection of the expression of
      thousands of genes simultaneously, and new generations of sequencing technology are even
      more powerful. Modern marker-assisted breeding is better at selecting target genotypes and
      can be used as a replacement for phenotyping; farmers and scientists no longer need to wait
      for the plant to grow and then observe before selecting the target gene or multiple genes.
      The number of lines that need to be tested is reduced, which enables more efficient use of
      greenhouse or field space.

      The use of genetic markers for prescreening animals for desired traits has also been
      successful in animal breeding. In the animal-genetics market, just one of the leading players,
      Neogen, genotyped more than two million animals in 2017. 308

      Marker-assisted selection is fairly commonplace in developed countries, but it is less
      prevalent in developing countries, demonstrating an opportunity. 309 With ever-increasing
      amounts of plant and animal DNA sequencing data and low-cost predictive microarrays that
      support high-volume population screening for genetic variation, marker-assisted selection
      could become universal in ten to 20 years, leading to an annual direct economic impact of
      about $300 billion through improved traits that can lower operating costs.

      Genetic engineering
      The first genetically engineered plant was tobacco, reported in 1983. 310 In 1994, the FDA
      approved the first genetically engineered crop, the Flavr Savr tomato, which was introduced
      commercially later that year and met with high demand because of its delayed ripening. 311
      Demand for the tomatoes remained high for a considerable period, but the product was never
      profitable due to high production and distribution costs. Other genetically engineered crops
      have been adopted rapidly in many countries—indeed, genetic engineering has become
      the fastest-adopted crop technology in the world. Today, genetically engineered crops cover
      12 percent of cropland, more than half of it in developing countries. 312

            In marker-assisted breeding, individual traits (such as disease resistance or quality) can be selected based on a marker,
            which can be morphological, biochemical, or a variation of DNA or RNA. Marker-assisted breeding uses conventional
            breeding approaches and does not involve transgenic approaches. See Jean-Marcel Ribaut and David Hoisington,

The first wave of genetically engineered crops focused on engineering input traits (for
instance, insect and herbicide tolerance) that affect farm practices such as the use of
chemicals. In the current wave, the focus increasingly is on engineering output traits that
affect characteristics relevant after harvest, such as prolonged shelf life. This could reduce
food waste or loss through handling, with benefits to producers, processors, retailers, and
consumers. There is some interest today in genetically engineered crops for consumer-facing
traits, such as improved health and biofortification to increase nutrient density.

New technologies, including CRISPR and TALEN, enable more precise gene editing of plants
and animals. In the case of crops, they can be tailored to local conditions such as humidity, soil
type, salinity, and temperature. Gene editing could improve R&D costs and time, and could
also shorten the regulatory timeline in some regions. For example, Inari is a startup that is in
the early stages of using CRISPR to personalize seeds for farmers. It aims to develop seeds
customized with the traits that help a crop grow best in particular local conditions such as
humidity, temperature, and soil type. 313

To harness the advantages of new gene-editing technologies, leading agricultural-input
companies are working with startups on R&D. In a collaboration and licensing agreement with
Monsanto (acquired by Bayer in 2018), startup Pairwise Plants is researching gene-editing
technology for corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and canola. 314 Players like Novozymes and
Inari are striking up partnerships with established seed producers of various sizes that have
long-standing relationships with farmers and growers to introduce omics-driven innovations.
Novozymes continued its partnership to commercialize microbial solutions with Bayer for corn
and soy, and in 2019, it also pursued a multipartner model to work with other companies in
the space. 315

CRISPR-edited produce could land on grocery store shelves in the United States over
the next ten years. 316 One of the first items to be sold could be sweeter strawberries with
an extended shelf life. Innovation in shelf life in a broader range of food products could make
a significant contribution to the global food supply given that roughly one-third of the food
produced in the world for human consumption every year—approximately 1.3 billion tons—is
lost or wasted. 317 Extending shelf life and reducing signs of spoilage are especially likely to
reduce food waste in industrialized countries, where more than 40 percent of losses occur at
the retail and consumer levels. In contrast, in developing countries 40 percent of losses occur
at the post-harvest handling, storage, and processing stages. 318

It is worth noting innovations beyond genetic engineering that combat plant disease and
increase shelf life. Portable DNA sequencing devices and other advances in biosensor
technology (such as CRISPR–Chip) show potential for use by farmers to diagnose plant
diseases, which would eliminate the need for mass use of pesticides. 319 Researchers on
the CRISPR–Chip project, conducted by Cardea, say it will take about five years of research
to find the right biomarkers, create the right chips, and then develop a device that’s durable
enough to be used in the field. 320

      Genetic editing to alter health and productivity in food animals such as dairy and beef
      cattle, swine, and poultry is still nascent. The first seafood from genetically enhanced
      production systems—AquaBounty’s AquAdvantage salmon, which grows twice as fast as
      normal salmon—was approved in the United States in November 2015 and six months later
      in Canada. 321 However, the introduction of the salmon to US consumers was delayed due
      to questions about appropriate labeling. The FDA approved an animal-drug application for
      genetically engineered salmon eggs in the United States in 2019, roughly 30 years after
      the initial development in the laboratory of AquAdvantage salmon. 322

      More recently, researchers have genetically engineered new traits of resistance against
      common diseases among animals, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
      in pigs. 323 The same approach was employed to produce more flavorful beef. 324 Outbreaks of
      disease such as African swine fever in 2019 have generated interest in new approaches to
      protect farm animals, including genetic engineering. In the near term, however, responses
      are more likely to be in the form of conventional vaccines rather than genetically engineered
      immunity. Overall, genetically engineered plant and animal production systems could
      generate annual direct impact of about $130 billion to $350 billion through reduced
      mortality, improved productivity, and higher-quality outputs in taste and nutrition content
      over the next ten to 20 years. Consumer acceptance will be key; public sensitivity surrounds
      genetically engineering animals (and crops), particularly for human consumption, which can
      shape adoption.

      Microbiome mapping and modification
      In addition to breeding and genetic engineering, the discovery and development of the full
      potential of microorganisms—bacteria, fungi, and viruses—has become an increasingly
      important focus of biological research. The microbiome of plants, soil, animals, and water
      also plays an important role in agricultural production. Applications in this area could make
      a significant contribution to improving the resilience of crops, reducing losses from drought,
      pests, and disease, and improving yields by, for instance, enabling plants to assimilate
      nutrients. In a world in which climate risk is rising and food insecurity continues to be
      a significant challenge, such capabilities could be highly beneficial. One company founded
      in 2014, Indigo, offers seed treatments based on naturally occurring microbes such as plant-
      friendly bacteria or fungi, which farmers apply to their seeds as a spray or powder coating
      before planting. Another example is Novozymes, which demerged from the pharmaceutical
      company Novo Nordisk and offers genetically engineered microbes (among other products)
      instead of traditional chemicals to improve yield and quality. 325

      Companies have been using high-throughput sequencing and machine learning to develop
      insights on microbial species in soil and help growers be more precise and economical in
      choosing seeds and other inputs. Similarly, sequencing, benchmarking, and restoring the gut
      microbiome of food-producing animals may improve feed utilization and can potentially
      improve animal health. For example, Novozymes offers probiotics to stabilize the gut flora
      of poultry, and CoreBiome offers large-scale microbiome sequencing and benchmarking.
      Given that fertilizer, chemicals, and animal feed make up a significant share of operating
      costs in agricultural production, these innovations could create annual direct impact of about
      $330 billion to $380 billion globally in the next ten to 20 years.

Innovative approaches in food production and safety could change what
we eat
Consumer interest in alternative protein sources is increasing globally due to concern about
health, the environment, and animal welfare. An analysis of consumer search queries on
Google found that cultured meat and new generations of plant-based meat substitutes
have been attracting increasing interest. Sales grew at a compound annual rate of 19 and
29 percent, respectively, between 2004 and 2019. Emerging companies are developing
alternative proteins that replicate the meat-eating experience. By 2030, a large share
of consumers may regard eating meat from animals as immoral. 326 Consumer attitudes
are already shifting about proteins from conventional animal sources. While there is
an opportunity to generate healthier and more nutritious food, plant-based meats available
today are primarily designed to compete with conventional meats in taste.

In this section, we look at innovation in the production of animal proteins as well as the role
biology can play in improving food safety standards. Overall, there could be direct annual
impact of about $40 billion to $125 billion over the next ten to 20 years.

Alternative proteins
Attitudes toward the type of food we eat are changing. Consumer awareness and interest in
plant-based meat or lab-grown meat is growing, often motivated by concerns about health,
animal welfare, and the environment.

Plant-based meat is derived from protein-rich seeds such as soy, chickpea, and rapeseed.
The taste and texture of these alternatives is getting closer to that of animal proteins as
producers expand their core market from vegetarians and vegans to include meat eaters.
Impossible Foods, for example, uses genetically engineered yeast to ferment heme, an iron-
containing blood molecule that imparts a metallic taste. Plant-based milk (products free of
milk proteins) took off in the mid-2000s and now accounts for about 15 percent of retail milk
sales in the United States and 8 percent in Britain. 327 Perfect Day Foods genetically engineers
microflora to ferment plant sugar into the dairy proteins whey and casein to make animal-
free milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. 328 A key impediment to broad adoption in this area
is the challenge of producing cost-efficiently at scale. While alternative proteins may have
significant potential, the market is still nascent, accounting for only 2 percent of the global
protein retail market, according to several estimates. Adoption of alternative proteins at scale
will depend heavily on their cost competitiveness and consumers’ taste preferences.

Several companies are rolling out new technologies and ingredients for the production of
alternative proteins. Cultured meat and seafood are made using tissue-culture technology,
a lab process by which animal cells are grown in vitro. This process creates muscle tissue that
mimics animal muscles and has the same protein profile. Cultured meat and seafood are not
yet available for purchase, but over the next ten years they could become cost competitive
with conventional animal production systems. Producers still face a major technical challenge
in finding a cost-effective way of growing cells. New players such as Finless Foods, Mosa
Meat, Memphis Meats, and Meatables are currently experimenting with different approaches,
including using synthetic molecules and pluripotent (the ability to produce several biological
responses) stem cells to replace expensive growth factors. 329 The price of cultured meat
has already plunged from more than $300,000 for the first lab-grown hamburger in 2013
to about $11 in 2015. 330 Products in development include lab-grown crustaceans from new

      players like Singapore-based Shio Meats, which is already trying out its lab-grown shrimp in
      dumplings. 331 Today, the alternative protein market (for land and sea) is valued at $2.2 billion,
      compared with a global meat market of about $1.7 trillion, according to the FAO. 332

      A shift to alternative proteins could have important environmental repercussions. Food
      production, from growing rice to raising livestock, is a primary source of anthropogenic
      methane, a GHG that is estimated to be about 85 times as potent as CO2 on a 20-year time
      frame. According to the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, which used data
      from more than 38,000 commercial farms in 119 countries, plant-based foods generate far
      fewer emissions than meat and dairy from livestock. 333 The Impossible Burger, which is made
      from plant-based proteins, produces about 97 percent fewer GHG emissions than traditional
      beef, which is the most resource-intensive type of meat. 334 Cultured meat could reduce GHG
      emissions by 80 percent or more compared with conventional meat if all the energy used
      in manufacturing comes from carbon-free sources. 335 If, however, the energy required for
      manufacturing cultured meat comes from carbon-intensive sources such as fossil fuels,
      reductions in GHG emissions would be limited. 336 The production of alternative proteins
      could significantly reduce land and water use, compared with conventional meat production
      processes. The land used for meat production could be repurposed to conserve habitats
      and protect biodiversity. Habitat conservation and reforestation also contribute to mitigating
      climate change.

      The rising consumption of seafood is exerting significant pressure on the marine environment.
      Overfishing is driving many fish species to the brink of extinction, endangering marine
      biodiversity and ecosystems. 337 Production of alternative proteins could help to alleviate
      pressure on the marine environment, but it would need to be conducted on a far larger scale
      than the current level.

      Genetic tracing of food origin, safety, and authenticity
      Food safety is a significant issue. According to WHO estimates, almost one in ten people
      (600 million people) in the world fall ill because of eating contaminated food and more than
      400,000 die every year. 338 DNA testing of raw and processed foods can provide insights
      about food safety and quality; allergens, genetically engineered content, and species can be
      identified using genetic markers. FoodChainID (formerly Global ID), founded in 1996, was one
      of the first labs to employ DNA bar-coding technology along the value chain to reduce food
      fraud and mislabeling. The initial focus was mainly on fish-based products. New players such
      as Clear Labs are taking advantage of DNA sequencing and other technologies and report
      that they can shorten turnaround times on testing for food safety from three to five days to 24
      hours as well as build searchable databases for food safety. 339 Consumers increasingly want
      to know what is in their food.

                                      of consumers. The speed of adoption is uncertain, partially because of widespread concern
                                      about data privacy and consumer safety (Exhibit 21). In this section, we discuss a range of
                                      biomolecules and biosystems innovations in consumer products and services. There are also
                                      advances in biomachine interfaces relevant in consumer products and services, which we

      The falling cost of DNA sequencing has enabled the most mature genomic and microbiome-
      based applications. Of the two, genomic-based consumer applications are further ahead
      because genomics research is more advanced than work based on the microbiome. Early
      DTC genetic tests focused on nonmedical uses, such as ancestry testing in the United States
      in 2000. DTC genetic testing for the risk of certain health conditions became available later
      partly because there was a need to provide stronger evidence of linkage between genetic
      data and health conditions in the United States, as required by the FDA. Adoption on a large
      scale remains far from certain given that the medical value of DTC testing is so far unproven—
      and that consumer privacy concerns are high. DTC microbiome testing is nascent but
      developing. Scientists are beginning to make headway in understanding how the microbiome
      affects consumer wellness. In the coming few decades, we might see adoption of various
      microbiome applications such as microbiome-friendly skin-care products that contain live
      bacteria. Adoption by consumers of applications based on other omics (such as personalized
      diet based on proteomics) is further behind genomics and microbiome-based applications,
      given the state of the science and high costs.

      Overall, the estimated annual direct impact from biomolecules and biosystems over the next
      ten to 20 years in consumer markets could be $200 billion to $700 billion globally, or
      16 percent of the total impact estimated from the roughly 400 use cases identified in our
      research (Exhibit 22). This potential stems from applications such as personal insights based
      on DTC genetic and microbiome testing and the subsequent personalization of related
      products and services such as advanced probiotics covering everything from gut health to
      weight loss to skin care.


      Biomolecules and biosystems could be applied to consumer products and
      services in four broad areas
      Biomolecules and biosystems innovations are being applied in four broad areas of consumer
      products and services: DTC genetic testing, wellness, beauty and personal care, and pets
      and pet care. We discuss additional consumer applications, including stress-monitoring
      headbands, brain-controlled gaming platforms, and other wearables in the later section on
      biomachine interfaces.

      DTC genetic testing
      The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 generated enormous demand from
      individuals for information about their genetic makeup. The emergence of DTC genetic
      testing in the United States in the early 2000s met the demand by giving individuals access
      to the information directly without the involvement of medical professionals. Consumers
      can send a saliva sample by mail and then view the results on a website or mobile app.
      The expansion and evolution of DTC genetic testing is being driven by a combination of
      intense commercial competition, strong consumer interest, large-scale research on the effect
      of genetics on human traits and health, and exponential advances in DNA sequencing
      technology. Overall, the annual direct impact could range between roughly $50 billion and
      $110 billion for health-related DTC genetic testing over the next ten to 20 years. 340 However,
      realizing this potential depends heavily on how consumers and regulators respond to
      significant concerns about data privacy.

                                      Early offerings focused on genealogy research, with Family Tree beginning ancestry testing
                                      in the United States in 2000, followed by companies such as 23andMe and AncestryDNA.
                                      By the end of 2018, more than 26 million people had taken an at-home ancestry DNA test in
                                      the United States. 341 These services expanded, exploring the potential relationship between
                                      a consumer’s genetic makeup and talents, preferences, and lifestyle aspects such as fitness
                                      and nutrition. However, some of these associations are weak or questionable (and we have not
                                      included them in our impact assessment).

                                      Second-generation DTC genetic testing, focused on genetic risk for certain health conditions,
                                      is now emerging. If the medical value can be proven and privacy and data security concerns
                                      are addressed, a new wave of users could be captured. 342 In 2017, the FDA allowed 23andMe
                                      to market DTC tests for ten conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s

      disease. 343 The FDA review led to more streamlined approval of health-related DTC genetic
      tests in the United States, paving the way for other startups to shift or expand their focus
      to health.

      Most current DTC testing typically uses a method based on single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP) analysis, which involves using a DNA microarray to detect the presence or absence
      of specific variations throughout the genes. 344 In SNP analysis, typically less than 1 percent
      of human genome is sequenced. 345 However, more comprehensive genome sequencing
      is becoming more popular as its cost declines due to technological advances; this, in
      turn, lends itself to a new business model. 346 Under a subscription-based revenue model,
      sequencing output can be a lifelong resource, enabling consumers to learn more and
      more about themselves as the pertinent science progresses. AncestryDNA’s new division
      Ancestry Health launched its new subscription-based service that leverages next-generation
      sequencing in 2020. 347

      Compared with the United States, China remains a nascent market for DTC genetic testing.
      A program conducted by the Shanghai Biochip Corporation to predict traits such as emotional
      control, focus, memory, and athletic ability, among others, based on genetic testing of
      children, emerged in 2009. 348 23MoFang, the largest provider of genetic testing services
      to Chinese consumers, had tested only about 500,000 consumers out of a population of
      1.4 billion as of fall 2019. 349 However, as the cost of DNA sequencing has fallen, these tests
      have become increasingly affordable for the average Chinese family, and this has triggered
      more than 100 companies to enter the segment over the past five years. 350 They include large
      players like Shenzhen-based WeGene and Beijing-based Novogene. DTC players are rapidly
      building awareness through China’s ubiquitous social media and e-commerce channels.
      They are increasingly tailoring their offerings to East Asian consumers who were previously
      underrepresented in the database of Western genetic test providers. 351

      Genome data enable new opportunities for personalization in consumer markets. The full
      range of what is scientifically possible is unclear, but some companies have already begun
      to experiment with personalized online dating to meal services, custom-tailored fitness, and
      other applications. 352 Companies ranging from professional services firms to app developers
      and retailers are offering applications based on personal biological data.

      Wellness
      Consumer wellness is a major area for biological applications. Regularly updated information
      about the gut and skin microbiomes as well as other molecules corresponding to different
      cellular functions may provide guidance for consumers’ behavior and lifestyle. Gene
      editing to increase muscle mass is currently being tested by biohackers and could become
      commercially available in about ten years. Acknowledging that genetic data on its own tells
      only part of the story about consumers’ biology, some startups take more holistic approaches.
      As with DTC genetic testing, emerging databases capturing the composition of consumers’
      microbiome and other variables could enable scientific advances leading to personalized


      343
            In 2018, the FDA “permitted marketing, with special controls, of the 23andMe Personal Genome Service
            Pharmacogenetic Reports test as a DTC consumer test for providing information about genetic variants that may be
            associated with a patient’s ability to metabolize some medications to help inform discussions with a health care provider.”

consumer products and new medical treatments. Overall, the annual direct impact could
range from roughly $40 billion to $300 billion for wellness applications over the next ten to
20 years.

Scientists are beginning to make headway in understanding how the microbiome affects
human health and disease, with much of this impact likely being mediated through diet.353
DTC microbiome testing is nascent but developing. In a similar way to genetic tests taken
at home, consumers collect a stool sample and mail it in for testing. In the future, collecting
critical genetic information about microbes contained in human saliva could simply take
a cheek swab. Some early commercial applications already exist. For instance, combining
analysis of microbiome and blood tests, Israeli company DayTwo provides nutrition insights
for people with diabetes through an app designed to maintain normal blood sugar levels. 354
Another area of interest is a new generation of probiotic and vitamin supplements customized
based on an individual’s microbiome rather than questionnaires about lifestyle. Microbiome-
testing companies ProTrea, Thryve, and SunGenomics, for instance, offer personalized
probiotic plans.

In the next few decades, it may become possible to measure and analyze an even broader
set of biological information in a cost-effective and convenient manner. This could transform
personal-health monitoring, especially for the elderly and people with chronic diseases, as
well as the tracking of fitness and nutrition. Today’s wearable devices are generally worn
around the wrist. The new frontier may be patches on the skin or even ingestible sensors.
Skin sensors work by detecting sweat, volatile organic compounds, microbes, or particles
in the surrounding environment. Startup LogicInk has developed skin sensors that measure
changes in biomarkers related to hydration and blood alcohol; this effort is at an early
stage. Ingestible sensors are pill-sized electronics that can transmit data such as video, pH,
temperature, pressure, and adherence to medication to a device such as a smartphone.

Beauty and personal care
Little public funding currently goes toward nonmedical gene therapies, as governments
and scientists focus on curing diseases as a priority. However, if private-sector beauty
and personal-care companies invest in this area and collaborate with researchers, those
therapies could become commercialized before 2050. Some established beauty and
personal-care companies have been conducting scientific research into the role of genomics
and microbiomics in innovative anti-aging skin-care products, working in skin biology labs
sometimes in collaboration with medical institutions. Some discoveries could emerge as
a byproduct of research in other areas. For example, Latisse was a cataract treatment that
had the side effect of making eyelashes grow. The treatment became a cosmetic eyelash
solution. 355 Overall, we estimate direct annual impact of roughly $50 billion to $150 billion for
skin care and oral microbiome products over the next ten to 20 years. 356

Research into the skin microbiome is ongoing. The skin microbiome is home to roughly 1,000
species of bacteria that can not only affect the health and appearance of skin but contribute
to common skin conditions such as acne and eczema as well as aging. 357 Biotech startup
AOBiome’s consumer division Mother Dirt is developing hygiene and personal-care products
filled with live ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which are most commonly found in dirt and
untreated water. The bacteria convert irritating components of sweat (ammonia and urea) and
turn them into byproducts that bring benefits to the skin. Historically, the bacteria would have

      populated the skin microbiome naturally, but widespread use of soaps, deodorants, and other
      personal-care products has significantly reduced their population. 358 Restoring those bacteria
      can remedy body odor or skin irritation issues, cut down on shower use and chemicals, and
      help in caring for wounds. 359 Established brands such as La Mer are increasingly moving
      into probiotics (for which there is no standardized definition), while new players such as Tula
      also offer probiotic skin care. However, unlike Mother Dirt’s microbiome products, the vast
      majority of probiotics products offered today do not contain live microorganisms that require
      refrigerated storage.

      Research is also ongoing into the relationship of the gut microbiome to the skin, referred to
      as the gut-skin axis. The gut may communicate with the skin in several ways, for example
      through the absorption of nutrients with a direct effect on the skin or those that can
      stimulate hormonal changes that affect the skin. 360 Viome’s gut microbiome test, for example,
      establishes links between gut bacteria and skin conditions such as acne and eczema, blurring
      the line between consumer markets and healthcare. Consumers have expressed considerable
      concern about inflammation caused by using products that are wrong for an individual’s
      skin. Microbiome (and genetic) testing to enable personalization and new products could
      have significant potential. Singapore-based genomics firm Imagene Lab, for instance, offers
      a personalized serum based on the results of its skin DNA tests that assess traits such as
      premature collagen breakdown.

      Researchers are also exploring microbial solutions to improve dental hygiene and beauty
      procedures based on the oral microbiome. For instance, probiotics derived from the dental
      plaque of healthy individuals sharply antagonize cariogenic bacteria (oral bacteria that cause
      tooth decay). However, the high cost of conducting clinical trials and the status of dental
      cavities as a non-life-threatening condition could continue to impede the advancement of
      new therapeutics to market. 361 Oral care probiotics could also deliver cosmetic benefits such
      as teeth whitening. For example, a recent clinical study found that mouthwash incorporating
      three natural hydrogen peroxide–producing oral bacterial strains has a statistically significant
      whitening effect. 362

      Finding genetic cures for hair loss and skin wrinkles, rather than simply slowing down
      the process, is one of the most eagerly sought outcomes of innovative anti-aging skin-care
      companies. The most common form of genetic hair loss is androgenetic alopecia—also
      known as pattern hair loss—that by the age of 50 affects about half of males and one-
      quarter of females. 363 With gene therapy, hair follicles with DHT-sensitive cells could be
      changed into follicles with DHT-resistant cells, and the hair follicles would continue to grow
      new hairs for a lifetime. 364 However, gene therapy for cosmetic uses such as aging skin and
      hair loss is unlikely to have significant economic potential in the time frame we investigated.
      The science is not yet feasible in humans, and it is not clear whether and when products may
      be commercially viable given that the regulatory response is uncertain.

Pets and pet care
There is interest in applying genetic and microbiome testing, as well as personalized
nutrition and precision medicine, to pets. Advances in this area could be of interest given
that the global pet-care market is expected to be valued at roughly $60 billion to $100 billion
by 2025. 365

DTC genetic and microbiome testing is coming to the world of pet owners. In 2005, less
than three years after the completion of the international effort to sequence the human
genome, researchers published a map of the canine genome using the DNA of a boxer.
Today, companies such as Wisdom Panel (a division of Mars Petcare), Embark Veterinary, and
Basepaws offer home DNA tests for cats and dogs that provide insights into ancestry, breed,
health predispositions, and traits.

Precision veterinary medicine is developing. For example, One Health Company is now
sequencing dogs’ cancer tumors and recommending targeted therapies normally used
to treat humans. 366 Innovation is also advancing in the microbiome of pets. For example,
AnimalBiome offers microbiome tests and supplements as well as fecal microbiome
transplant capsules to replace and rebalance bacteria that are missing and restore the health
of a pet’s gut. 367 Overall, the estimated direct annual impact ranges from $60 billion to
$102 billion for innovation in pets and pet care in the next ten to 20 years.

The GloFish brand, which estimates that it has 15 percent of the US market for aquatic fish
sales, has been offering genetically engineered fluorescent fish since 2004. 368 Genetic
engineering could potentially also be applied to pets to accelerate some of the crossbreeding
seen today (think of breeds like the miniature goldendoodle, a cross between the golden
retriever and the toy, miniature, or small standard poodle) and to address pet health problems
such as allergies. Gene therapy could fix health conditions to which certain breeds are
genetically predisposed, such as hip dysplasia in golden retrievers and Labradors, and heart
conditions in Great Danes). In some cases, gene therapy could also improve performance
of animals. For instance, in Argentina scientists have already used CRISPR to rewrite
the sequence of the myostatin gene, which is crucial to muscle development, in cloned polo
ponies, the most cloned animal in the world. 369 Another application that taps into human
beings’ emotional attachment to their pets is gene preservation and pet cloning. Pet cloning
has been available for years in South Korea and the United States from companies such as
ViaGen Pets and Sooam, but it has not taken off. Sinogene, a Beijing-based commercial pet-
cloning company, has been cloning dogs for years and began cloning cats in 2019. 370

                                      The Bio Revolution: Innovations transforming economies, societies, and our lives                                127


      Labs around the world are now using genetically engineered microbes to improve
      the economics of fermentation, develop new fermentation processes, and even produce novel
      materials with previously unimaginable properties, like the ability of fabrics to self-repair.
      Genetic tracing of where fabrics come from and their authenticity is another application.
      Advances in the production of biofuels as well as new forms of energy storage are under
      way. However, with few exceptions, the scale has not been as large as many promised, in
      part due to cost competitiveness compared to existing substitutes, challenges in scaling,
      and supply chain constraints. Current work in the field of energy storage has produced
      theoretical proofs of scientific feasibility, but applications have not yet been commercialized
      and scaled effectively.

      Our assumptions about the timing of adoption are conservative for a number of reasons.
      First, scaling new innovations in materials, chemicals, and energy has historically been
      difficult. Cost is often a critical factor, because the innovations may be more expensive than
      the commoditized established products against which they must compete, including plastics
      and natural gas, which also can have well-established supply chains. For example, biofuels
      promised to be a viable alternative to petroleum, but they have not yet come close to replacing
      traditional fuel. Innovation in materials production processes has been slow because of
      high fixed costs. Broadly speaking, biotech applications remain more expensive than
      petroleum-based products—particularly biofuels produced through fermentation. Although
      the production of hydrocarbon fuels from biomass is technically possible, reducing production
      costs to commercially viable levels remains a challenge. In summary, the science may be in
      place (the first step toward adoption), but there are still challenges here in the second step of
      ensuring that the economics work by creating a compelling value proposition for customers
      and being able to industrialize the science and scale production.

      Second, enormous uncertainty about the likely impact surrounds these technologies. For
      example, entirely novel materials with large potential may be on the horizon, but it is difficult to
      anticipate (and therefore measure) this today. Many companies are likely to tailor materials to
      meet the unique demands of clients. Predicting all the novel materials that could be produced
      through biological methods, and the potential economic impact created, is challenging. Our
      working hypothesis is that the potential is significant.

      Overall, in the next ten to 20 years, we estimate the potential annual direct impact from
      biomolecules and biosystems via the production of materials, chemicals, and energy using
      advances in biology at about $200 billion to $300 billion globally, which is 8 percent of
      the total direct impact from our library of about 400 use cases (Exhibit 24). The eventual
      economic potential of novel materials—that is, materials having new properties not currently
      available—could be large, although there is considerable uncertainty about which novel
      materials and methods may emerge. In comparison, the impact in this time frame from energy
      production and storage is likely to be relatively limited given the challenges of competing with
      the economics of traditional processes. Energy sources and storage are relatively nascent
      technologies, and significant impact from sized applications in the next ten to 20 years is
      not expected.

                                      Three types of advances in materials and chemicals could affect
                                      various sectors
                                      In materials and chemicals, we highlight three areas: improving existing fermentation
                                      processes, developing new bioroutes for the production of existing materials and chemicals,
                                      and the production of novel materials and chemicals. There is substantial potential for impact
                                      by introducing improved economics to the production of materials and chemicals, improving
                                      their quality, or both, and by producing them in a more sustainable way. In materials and
                                      chemicals, applications are increasingly seen in, or could spread to, sectors as diverse as
                                      pharmaceuticals, plastics, fragrances, fabrics, and construction.

                                      Improve existing fermentation
                                      The first area for potential impact is further optimizing the economics of the production
                                      of goods currently made through fermentation. Globally, many established large players
                                      active in fermentation-based production, including, for instance, Corbion, DSM, and
                                      Novozymes, are devoting significant investment to further improving their technology
                                      platforms and capabilities. In addition, over the past decade a number of new biotech
                                      companies have emerged that offer new and improved biological capabilities that further



                                      The Bio Revolution: Innovations transforming economies, societies, and our lives                            129


      enhance fermentation and other bioroutes for the development of products; two examples
      are Ginkgo Bioworks and Synthace. These newer companies are positioning themselves
      largely as businesses that can help incumbents improve the efficiencies and economics of
      existing industrial fermentation manufacturing processes and product development work. In
      combination, the push in this area by both incumbents and startups to improve fermentation
      processes could offer significant potential for cost savings in affected industries.

      New bioroutes for existing materials and chemicals
      Another dynamic area is new bioroutes, primarily using fermentation-based methods, to
      manufacture products that are difficult or costly to synthesize chemically or extract from
      natural resources. One industry showing promise and attracting considerable interest is
      textiles. In recent years, methods have been developed to produce alternative nylon, silk,
      cotton, and clothing dyes using biological methods. As the effectiveness of these production
      methods in materials and chemicals develops, new bioroutes are spreading to other
      subsegments of the chemicals and pharmaceuticals markets, such as cosmetics and even
      masonry, that have traditionally been dominated by natural extraction or chemical reactions.

      For many of these industries, shifting production to bioroutes is attractive not only to capture
      efficiency gains but also to respond to a desire to produce more sustainably. Consider
      the case of nylon that has traditionally been manufactured from petrochemical components. 371
      Now, a new way of producing nylon with engineered microorganisms has recently been
      commercialized. For example, caprolactam, a key ingredient in making 100 percent
      sustainable nylon, is being produced using biological means by Genomatica and Aquafil. 372
      The textiles industry has many other examples of producing alternatives to current materials.
      Mango Materials uses waste methane to produce PHA, a polymer that is then spun into
      thread. Bolt Threads partnered with The North Face in 2015 to develop a parka made from
      artificial spider silk. The parka did not make it to market, but four years later the companies
      created a follow-up using a new textile made of synthetic fermented proteins. 373 These
      techniques could disrupt an industry that is today valued at more than $200 billion. 374

      Similarly, the industrial manufacturing of cosmetics stands to gain from a transition to
      bioroutes. One prime example is the biological production of squalene, which is traditionally
      derived from unsustainable sources, including oil byproducts and shark livers. Amyris
      Biossance commercialized a sugarcane-derived substitute, which is used to produce
      high-end, high-performance cosmetic products. These and other renewably sourced
      and Ecocert-approved products can unlock a new segment of environmentally conscious
      customers. 375 Fermentation-based manufacturing is also being applied to natural
      fragrances that are difficult to extract. For instance, Ginkgo Bioworks identified the DNA
      sequences of the enzymes that produce rose-oil compounds. In the past, using traditional
      methods, 60,000 roses were used to make 30 milliliters of rose oil. 376 This resource-
      heavy process has now been replaced by commercial-scale fermentation, which is more
      environmentally sustainable. 377

      Many of the players in these areas are still in the early stages and haven’t fully scaled their
      technologies, manufacturing, and commercialization. However, more players, both new
      and existing, and investment capital are focusing on these areas to find more efficient and
      sustainable ways to produce products.

Production of novel materials and chemicals
Bioroutes are also being used to create entirely new materials and chemicals with superior
properties such as greater strength and durability and the ability to self-repair. While still
nascent, several players are already bringing novel, differentiated bio-based products to
market. For example, in April 2019, Zymergen announced a partnership with Sumitomo
Chemical to develop bioroutes for the development of novel bio-based building blocks for
next-generation electronics. 378 The companies announced that their partnership may include
applications such as optical films for displays, hard coatings that won’t scratch, flexible
electronics circuits, and adhesive materials.

Inputs for agriculture are developing that use bioroutes to produce improved fertilizers and
pesticides. These are still in their proof-of-concept stage and earlier in their development
than the bioroutes in materials and chemicals that we have noted. For example, inputs for
the agricultural industry using RNAi gene silencing are being designed to establish a new
kind of pesticide. The expression of a gene critical for a life function of insects is inhibited
by specific RNA via spray or oral delivery. 379 The first RNAi insecticide was approved for
commercial use in 2017. 380


Innovative approaches are under way in energy production, extraction,
and storage, but the timing of impact is uncertain
Some developments are taking place in the production of biofuels, the extraction of raw
materials, and the storage of energy. There is potential for biology-based fuels that offer
an alternative to traditional fossil fuels, thereby helping to meet growing energy demand and
address global concerns about CO2 emissions and climate change. Another area of growing
interest is using biological approaches to improving energy storage, including, for instance,
biology-based fuel cells and using engineered microorganisms to create advanced electrodes
for next-generation batteries. However, the impact of innovation in these areas is estimated
to be small, because current biological technology alternatives are not able to compete on
cost and energy density with existing petroleum technologies. The pace of innovation in this
field also varies. While there may be some innovations in biofuels over the next few decades,
biology-based energy storage is unlikely to experience significant commercialization over
the next 30 years.

Biofuels
First-generation biofuels, particularly bioethanol for transportation produced from sugars
and starch, have existed for decades. Ethanol has been produced using fermentation
of carbohydrates produced in sugar- or starch-bearing plants like corn or sugarcane. 381
Demand for the resulting bioethanol has been growing steadily, and this has fueled interest in
improving technologies through biological advances. 382

In the advanced biofuels industry, a number of innovations may eventually have an impact on
the transportation industry. Some companies are using genetically engineered microbes to
create fuel for the aviation and marine industries. 383 Based in the United States, biochemicals
and biofuels company Gevo has developed aviation fuel that synthesizes hydrocarbons
to create renewable jet fuels in various ways that the company describes as “alcohol-
to-jet, oil-to-jet, syngas-to-jet, and sugar-to-jet.”384 It is also developing a fermentation

      process to produce isobutanol from corn-based fermentable sugar. 385 Algenol Biofuels has
      demonstrated the ability to produce ethanol using engineered algae. Norwegian cruise ship
      and ferry company Hurtigruten is planning to power its ships by processing fish waste from
      the fishing and animal-feed industries into an oil. 386

      Many of these technologies are in the early stage of development, and their economics
      remain challenging. Such innovations require high up-front capital investments, and it is
      difficult to reach sufficient scale in production to make the economics work. Many companies
      have tried and failed. One example is the bipartisan US government effort to make cellulosic
      ethanol from plants, a program that ran for 11 years. This resulted in increased production
      of this “second-generation” (2G) biofuel that uses not only the starch of the plant, but all of
      its biomass, making it a more efficient process and therefore less competitive with the food
      supply. However, by 2017, only 10 million gallons were produced, less than 0.1 percent of
      the target. 387 Given the relatively low cost and convenience of crude oil, more sustainable
      options will likely continue to face challenges in competing on economics alone, absent
      antipollution incentives. As a result, although this area appears promising, its potential
      remains relatively small based on current market factors in the timescale we have analyzed.

      Extraction of energy sources and other raw materials
      Extraction of raw materials, including oil, from the earth may be enhanced using genetically
      engineered microbes. Sequencing microorganisms could help determine an optimal oil drilling
      site; DNA testing of microbes from rock samples to help pinpoint areas with the biggest
      potential could shave costs by as much as 10 percent, some estimates suggest. 388 Microbial
      assessment and treatment can also reduce the impact of microbiologically influenced
      corrosion (as microorganisms adhere to the surfaces of metals and nonmetallic materials,
      forming a biofilm under which corrosion occurs) in oil extraction and transportation. 389 If this
      technology bears fruit, it could be applied to the extraction of gold and other metals, too.
      Microbial-enhanced oil recovery is another interesting area; this involves microbes designed
      to direct crude oil upward to the surface by breaking it down to reduce its viscosity.

      Energy storage
      Biological advances that improve the storage of energy have been a topic of broad interest in
      academic research over the past few decades, but practical applications have been limited.
      Efforts have focused on two main areas with potential to disrupt the energy landscape—
      biobatteries and the use of engineered microorganisms to create advanced electrodes for
      next-generation batteries.

      Biobatteries are essentially fuel cells that use enzymes to produce electricity from
      sugar. Interest is growing in their ability to convert easily storable fuel found in everyday
      sugar into electricity and the potential energy density this would provide. At 596 ampere
      hours per kilogram, the density of sugar would be ten times that of current lithium-ion
      batteries. Additional benefits would include low fuel costs, portability to remote settings,
      and sustainability. However, recent advances have not led to any commercialized, cost-
      competitive solutions, and practical uses are unlikely to emerge in the near future. Barriers
      that need to be overcome include the short shelf life of the microorganisms and falling
      efficiencies as solutions are scaled up. 390

Potentially more applicable in the near term is the use of engineered microorganisms to
create advanced electrodes in next-generation batteries. Broadly, microorganisms, including
bacteria, fungi, and viruses, have the potential to develop high-performance electrodes
because they are able to reproduce quickly and are susceptible to gene modification,
biomineralization, and self-assembly. Specifically, lithium-air devices have received both
academic and commercial attention as a potential next-generation battery technology,
but the need for advanced electrodes remains. Synthesis of these electrodes using
microorganisms has been demonstrated to be possible in a process directed by certain
types of virus. 391 As industrial interest in these types of high-performance electrode material
production increases, microorganisms show potential to provide a low-cost synthesis that
could accelerate developments in energy storage.

6.5. Sustainability and
     other applications
    Bio innovations within the arenas of biomolecules and biosystems may apply to other areas
    beyond the “big four” of healthcare; agriculture; consumer products and services; and
    materials, chemicals, and energy. Here, we focus on several nascent applications, including
    developments that could undo environmental harm, further space exploration, or be used in
    education and security.

    These potential applications—and eventual impact—are highly uncertain. They probably
    will unfold only in the longer term, and they come with sometimes significant risks. For all of
    these caveats, we have nonetheless attempted to size the potential impact over the next ten
    to 20 years, based on the limited use cases we have compiled. Excluding space exploration,
    for which we do not expect applications to become commercially available before 2050, we
    estimate the potential direct annual impact of these other applications, taken together, at
    roughly $25 billion to $45 billion globally.


    Biosequestration and bioremediation could help address
    environmental challenges
    The world faces interrelated environmental challenges. The climate is changing. The planet’s
    average temperature has risen 1.1 degrees Celsius due to man-made GHG emissions in
    the past century, and average temperatures are set to rise further. 392 As they do, climate
    science finds that acute hazards such as heat waves and floods grow in frequency and
    severity, and chronic hazards, such as drought and rising sea levels, intensify. 393 The WHO
    estimates that an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient
    (outdoor) air pollution. 394 Biodiversity is vital, making production systems and livelihoods
    resilient to shocks and stresses, including climate change. The United Nations reports
    “unprecedented” loss of species, with extinction threatening about one million of the planet’s
    estimated eight million plant and animal species, many within decades. In addition, the FAO
    says that biodiversity in food and agriculture is in decline. 395

    Throughout this report, we discuss uses of omics and molecular technologies that have
    the potential to indirectly reduce carbon emissions and environmental degradation through
    less environmentally stressful, biological means of producing materials or conducting
    agriculture. Here we discuss work under way to directly monitor, and reverse, harm already
    done to the environment. We look at three categories of potential applications of omics
    and molecular technologies: biosequestration, bioremediation, and monitoring for signs of
    environmental and ecological damage. We have estimated the potential of the first two, which
    our analysis suggests could have an impact of $15 billion to $30 billion over the next ten to
    20 years. It is important to note that the technologies are at an early stage, and taking these
    applications from the lab to large-scale use—for instance, on cropland around the world—will
    hinge on more than scientific advances, including making the economics work and addressing
    the profound risks that come with these transformative technologies, as discussed in
    chapter 3 of this report.

      Biosequestration
      GHG emissions, including those from changes in land use, reached a record high of
      75.9 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2) in 2018. 396 Stabilizing the climate will require
      a transition to net zero carbon emissions, including at-scale removal of CO2 from
      the atmosphere.

      Biosequestration is the term for biological means of taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. 397 Over
      the long term, the full adoption of omics and molecular technologies in biosequestration could
      potentially capture about 1.2 to 1.4 GtCO2. In this section, we look at three agents of carbon
      biosequestration—plants, algae, and bacteria—whose carbon sequestration efficiency could
      be potentially enhanced by omics and molecular technologies:

      — Plants. Even with extremely optimistic assumptions about new carbon dioxide removal
        approaches, there would still need to be very large-scale nature-based CO2 removal. 398
        Plants have been performing this role for millions of years, but the loss of forested habitat
        has limited the scale of nature-based carbon capture. To meet the challenge of keeping
        global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius, as set out by the Intergovernmental
        Panel on Climate Change, reforestation on a massive scale would be needed between
        now and 2030. 399 An area at least twice the size of Iceland—and potentially as large
        as the United Kingdom—would need to be reforested annually. Omics and molecular
        technologies could supplement the effort. Genetically engineered plants can potentially
        store more CO2 for longer periods than their natural counterparts. Plants normally take in
        CO2 from the atmosphere and store carbon in their roots. The Harnessing Plant Initiative
        at the Salk Institute is using gene editing to create plants with deeper and more extensive
        root systems that can store more carbon than typical plants. These roots are also
        engineered to produce more suberin or cork, a naturally occurring carbon-rich substance
        found in roots that absorbs carbon, resists decomposition (which releases carbon back
        into the atmosphere), may enrich soil, and helps plants resist stress. When these plants
        die, they release less carbon back into the atmosphere than conventional plants. If
        about 5 percent of the world’s cropland—or about the land area planted with genetically
        engineered soybeans in the United States in 2018—were to be planted with crops with
        the traits being explored, as much as 0.8 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent could be captured
        every year, according to the Salk Institute. 400 As a comparison, the total CO2 emissions of
        the global airline industry were about 0.9 gigatonnes in 2018. 401

            Widespread adoption of genetically engineered plants involves challenges, uncertainties,
            and risks, however. Thus far, most genetically engineered plants have been developed
            in the lab and have yet to be tested in major crops in the field. Additionally, regulatory
            barriers could impede their adoption. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled
            in July 2018 that gene-edited crops should be subject to the same stringent regulations
            as conventional GM organisms. 402 As with all bio innovations, the economics of these
            plants would need to work to persuade farmers to adopt them. Overall, it is likely that any
            shift to genetically engineered plants for the purposes of carbon sequestration will not
            happen quickly.




      396
            Total GHG emissions, including from land use, land-use change, and forestry, were 75.9 GtCO2e in 2018, according to
            the UN’s Emissions gap report 2019. All GHG emission figures are expressed using 20-year global warming potential
            (GWP20).

— Algae. Algae, present throughout the biosphere but particularly in marine and freshwater
  environments, are among the most efficient organisms for carbon sequestration and
  photosynthesis; they are generally considered photosynthetically more efficient than
  terrestrial plants. 403 Potential uses of microalgal biomass after sequestration could include
  biodiesel production, fodder for livestock, and production of colorants and vitamins. Using
  microalgae to sequester carbon has a number of advantages. They do not require arable
  land and are capable of surviving well in places that other crop plants cannot inhabit,
  such as saline-alkaline water, land, and wastewater. Because microalgae are tiny, they
  can be placed virtually anywhere, including cities. They also grow rapidly. Most important,
  their CO2 fixation efficiency has been estimated at ten to 50 times higher than that of
  terrestrial plants. 404

      Editing tools, including CRISPR–Cas9 and TALEN, are already being used to alter
      microalgal genes; tools that interfere with genes, including miRNA and siRNA, are
      also being explored. 405 In 2017, a team of scientists genetically engineered one type of
      microalgae and increased its capacity to perform photosynthesis by 1.2 times. 406 Several
      companies, including Fermentalg and UEZ, are working on commercializing microalgae
      technology. 407 They have designed genetically engineered algae capable of capturing CO2
      and transforming it into biofuels. Despite enormous potential and some innovation among
      startups, microalgae-based biosequestration has not reached significant scale, and
      there are hurdles both upstream and downstream to scaling up and commercialization.
      For example, algae cultivation based on the aqua-suspend method has low biomass
      productivity. 408 It requires a large amount of water and energy, which makes scaling
      up challenging. 409

— Bacteria. Many bacteria have the ability to sequester atmospheric CO2. 410 They have
  a number of advantages, including the fact that they can be produced rapidly, are
  proficient at fixing carbon, have a high capacity to produce a wide range of additive
  (biodegradable) products, including biofuels and bioplastics, and are relatively easy to
  genetically engineer. Scientists have reengineered one bacterium that eats a diet of simple
  sugars into one that builds its cells by absorbing CO2. For now, commercial applications
  are limited and technical challenges remain (in improving carbon fixation, for instance),
  but advances could perhaps lead to the development of engineered microbes that extract
  CO2 out of the air and turn it into medicines and other high-value compounds. 411

Bioremediation
Bioremediation is a process that aims to remove toxins from the environment—soil, water,
and the atmosphere—by using biological organisms, including plants, algae, fungi, and
microorganisms. Today, some scientists are testing genetic engineering in bioremediation
to create a sustainable, potentially cost-effective system to remove inorganic and organic
compounds that may be harmful to the environment.

      One example is genetically engineered microbes that can be used to break down waste and
      toxins, and could, for instance, be used to reclaim mines. 412 Some headway is being made
      in using microbes to recycle textiles. Processing cotton, for instance, is highly resource-
      intensive, and dwindling resources are constraining the production of petroleum-based
      fibers such as acrylic, polyester, nylon, and spandex. There is a great deal of waste, with
      worn-out and damaged clothes often thrown away rather than repaired. 413 Less than 1 percent
      of the material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, representing a loss of
      more than $100 billion a year. 414 Los Angeles–based Ambercycle has genetically engineered
      microbes to digest polymers from old textiles and convert them into polymers that can
      be spun into yarns. Engineered microbes can also assist in the treatment of wastewater.
      In the United States, drinking water and wastewater systems account for between 3 and
      4 percent of energy use and emit more than 45 million tons of GHG a year. 415 Microbes—also
      known as microbial fuel cells—can convert sewage into clean water as well as generate
      the electricity that powers the process. 416

      As is the case with biosequestration, most bioremediation technologies are still being tested
      in the lab, are not yet scaled and commercialized, and potentially will need to surmount public
      and regulatory misgivings that could surface with all types of genetic engineering.

      Monitor the environment
      Genomics can be used to monitor genetic biodiversity, carry out biosurveillance of invasive
      species, identify environmental issues such as contamination and pollution, and potentially
      do so more quickly and effectively than is currently possible. For example, genetic tools can
      be used in the conservation of endangered species by improving the monitoring of genetic
      biodiversity and using genetic information as evidence in court in poaching cases. 417 Genomic
      tools can be used to better understand and potentially manage invasive species, including by
      offering insights into mechanisms of invasions and the role of genetic variation. 418 Additionally,
      instead of using animals, genomics-based animal-free systems have been used for better,
      faster, and cheaper toxicity testing of thousands of chemicals that affect the health of
      ecosystems and the animals within them in a range of contexts, from oil and chemical spills to
      everyday pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. 419


      Defense and security also lend themselves to some biological applications,
      although the risks could outweigh the benefits
      An emerging set of applications that apply omics or molecular technologies could potentially
      be used in the area of defense and security. These applications are all nascent—and fraught
      with risks and ethical considerations. Society and governments will need to heavily weigh
      the associated risks and the potential unintended consequences. While the applications have

potential benefits or may mark improvements on existing substitutes, their use could erode
public trust or increase geopolitical risk.

Some applications are already being used in security and law enforcement, such as DNA
sequencing for policing—which is raising significant privacy concerns. It may be possible in
the future to use DNA testing as biometric verification to open bank accounts, to prevent
credit card fraud, and even to use security lines at airports. It is unlikely that the cost and
speed of DNA testing will be low enough within the time frame of 30 years to replace the next
best alternative, namely fingerprint scanning, which is instantaneous and inexpensive.
As noted in the earlier section on consumer applications, the use of DNA testing for
these purposes carries significant privacy concerns (and worries about false positives
and negatives).

In defense, the applications surveyed but not sized include improving the effectiveness
of armed forces through genetic engineering, and developing offensive or defensive
bioweapons. Intense resistance to any movement toward genetically modifying troops
is likely, especially in democratic countries. However, if the field benefits appear to be
sufficiently compelling, some countries may try to adopt such applications, potentially setting
off a new arms race.


Bio innovations may affect education and talent development, but
scientific challenges and ethical concerns need to be considered
Bio innovation could be applied to education and the development of talent. In education,
potential applications include personalizing learning based on genetic profiles, if omics and
molecular technologies enable us to make a more nuanced understanding of what each child
needs in order to learn most effectively by analyzing DNA variants such as memory, reaction
time, and learning ability. It may be possible to use genetic profiling to detect students who
are more prone to dropping out of school and channel more resources toward them to prevent
it. 420 It may also be possible to actively identify learning disorders that have links to genetic
profiles (such as ADHD and dyslexia, as proxies) early, and for appropriate therapeutic
interventions to be taken. 421 In the case of training, genetic profiling could be used to counsel
individuals toward particular career paths based on predicted talents. Athletes could be
selected based on their genetics, which is already happening in Australia and China and
could spread to other countries. 422 The direct impact could be between roughly $3 billion and
$5 billion over the next ten to 20 years from premium learning programs tailored based on
genomes, but most applications might not have impact before 2050.

Ethical concerns cannot be discounted. The morality of determining (or even suggesting)
educational or career pathways based upon genetics is fraught, based on today’s evidence
and knowledge. It is already known that teachers’ expectations have a strong impact on actual
outcomes for their students. Therefore, a teacher even suggesting that some students are
less likely to succeed and could, for instance, be better suited for a vocational pathway could
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Furthermore, predetermining children’s educational paths
based on their genetics could reinforce inequality if these tools are open only to the wealthy
or to citizens of countries that take a permissive view of regulation in this area. For these
reasons, biological advances in this field should be treated with the utmost caution.

      Space exploration is another area where there is interest in using omics
      and molecular technologies
      Bio innovations could be used to improve space exploration. The use of omics and molecular
      technologies in the space industry is fascinating but, at this point, highly speculative. For this
      reason, we have not estimated what the potential impact might be. In any case, any impact
      could emerge beyond 2050. It is possible that omics and molecular technologies could
      eventually be used to develop habitats in space, or to study aging in space in the near future to
      gain insights into how human beings age on Earth:

      — Space habitat. It may in future be possible to use genetically engineered microbes to
        terraform other planets, such as Mars. 423 Biofoundries could be established that test
        millions of DNA designs in parallel to identify organisms that could be most suitable for
        the environment or most useful as a food source on Mars—if there is one day a migration
        there for whatever reason. 424 It may also be possible to construct Martian habitats more
        efficiently and in a more environmentally responsible way using mushrooms, which
        can be genetically engineered to secrete certain substances like bioplastics. 425 In
        the nearer term, short of terraforming another planet, omics and molecular technologies
        could usefully enable more sustainable generation of oxygen and food sources in
        controlled environments.

      — Space-based health. More probable in a reasonable time frame are applications of
        space-based health. Astronauts have been conducting space travel since 1961, and
        bio innovations may be helpful in several areas. Medical advances can inform optimized
        space health and survival, and conversely, medical research in space can yield findings
        that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible to identify on Earth. It may be
        possible to tailor pharmacology to the personal genomic profile of astronauts to enable
        them to stay healthy in space. NASA is currently conducting research on aging in space
        (since living beings age faster in space) in order to study the physiology of aging and
        disease progression on Earth. 426 NASA followed twin astronauts on a year-long mission
        on the International Space Station to explore molecular and physiological traits that
        may be affected by spending prolonged periods in space. The NASA Twins Study found
        that the length of telomeres, which are important to cell division, changed substantially
        during space flight and then again on return to Earth. The study also found changes
        in DNA methylation in immune cells as well as cardiovascular and cognitive effects. 427
        NASA’s Artemis program is looking at how partial gravity affects the body compared with
        microgravity, science that could potentially be applied to future visits to Mars. Another
        potential area for study is how to protect human beings from radiation in space. 428 As
        far off as they may seem, there could be uses for such technological approaches in
        improving health—of people on Earth and in space—resulting in downstream impacts on
        the pharmaceutical industry.

6.6. Biomachine interfaces

    Over the past decade, more complex and advanced algorithms and systems have made
    the development of true biomachine interfaces possible. Refinements to methods for
    detecting brain signals are creating higher-quality, more detailed data. More advanced
    analytics processing, supported by ever more sophisticated AI and machine learning, enables
    better interpretation of signals with the future promise of identifying specific phrases or
    conscious commands from users. Other technical improvements are enabling the translation
    of brain data into action at a greater level of precision; an example is the development of
    prosthetic hands that are capable of detailed motions. The potential exists to create stable
    systems in which computers and AI augment the capabilities of the brain. The scope of
    applications for biomachine interfaces is very broad.

    Biomachine interfaces create impact in several domains, including neuroprosthetics that
    restore hearing or vision in human health and performance, and headbands for monitoring
    stress levels from electric signals in consumer products and services. The timing of adoption
    of applications will vary. The most advanced biomachine interfaces are currently in healthcare.
    Many of them are not likely to be commercialized within the next ten years (Exhibit 25).

                                      Biomachine interfaces could have many applications in healthcare
                                      We examine two main groups of applications in healthcare: neuroprosthetics involving
                                      establishing stable systems between a machine and the patient’s nervous system to replace
                                      or restore neural inputs and outputs, and other treatments or diagnostic technologies that
                                      stimulate the brain or interpret its signals.

                                      Neuroprosthetics
                                      Neuroprosthetics link the human nervous system to computers, thereby providing control of
                                      prosthetic limbs and restoring lost sensory function. 429 Already well established are cochlear
                                      implants for hearing, which have been widely available since the late 1980s. Continuing
                                      refinements in these technologies are likely. They include more sophisticated analytics for
                                      auditory signal processing to enable improved recognition of sounds and language. Improved
                                      devices that are easier to implant and use are another possibility. 430 Substantial developments

      have been made in bionic vision over the past 20 years. For instance, SecondSight has
      developed a retinal implant called the Argus II that has restored notable functions to patients,
      including the ability to distinguish shapes, sense light, and even read print at a basic level in
      some cases. 431 The EU approved Argus II in 2011. 432 The United States approved it two years
      later. 433 This technology is relatively new, so there should be refinements in the quality of vision
      enabled and broader distribution to patients.

      Neuroprosthetics for motor control for people who have lost limbs or who have intact limbs
      but have lost control due to nervous system damage have made significant progress (Exhibit
      27). In the past, the first group had no control over a prosthetic. But now patients who still
      have nervous system connections are able to use myoelectric devices that respond to
      electrical signals from muscles. 434 One such device is the Hero Arm from Open Bionics. 435
      Now, researchers are developing neuroprosthetic limbs that receive signals from a surgically
      implanted chip in the patient’s brain. A team from the University of Chicago now has funding
      to develop these devices. 436 In addition, advanced motor-control neuroprosthetics are being
      developed that feed information directly from prostheses to the brain, creating a sense of
      touch that better enables control of motion. 437 Scientists at ETH Zurich have created sensors
      in bionic feet that send signals back to the tibial nerve in the leg, enabling patients to feel their
      prosthetic feet in real time. 438

      There have been large advances in prostheses for paraplegic patients who need to be able to
      sense brain signals directly that can be transmitted to their muscles. The MoreGrasp device is
      a headset with external electrodes that interprets brain signals. 439 Other devices are implanted
      in the brain. Scientists demonstrated this approach in experiments in 2015 using two rhesus
      monkeys that had suffered nerve damage leading to the loss of control in one leg. Chips
      were implanted in their skulls that were able to translate motor cortex signals into electrical
      impulses sent to the legs. Both monkeys recovered the ability to walk within two weeks,
      indicating the potential for this approach to be used in human patients. 440 Another application
      is the brain-controlled exoskeleton operated through a headset or an implant. One team
      developed an exoskeleton that could be controlled by a headset, and the paraplegic patient
      recovered enough motion control to perform the symbolic kickoff at the 2014 World Cup. 441

      Researchers are even now exploring the possibility of directly translating language from
      patients’ brains to computers—brain-to-device communications—using either a surgically
      inserted neuroprosthetic device or a headband. This technique could have significant
      benefits for patients who are suffering from “locked-in syndrome” paraplegia and have
      lost the ability to control their vocal cords. 442 Today, such patients either are unable to
      communicate or have to use technologies such as eye-tracking devices that painstakingly
      spell out words letter by letter. 443 In 2019, researchers at the University of California, San
      Francisco, reported using neuroprosthetics to receive and interpret brain signals in the part of
      the motor cortex that controls the larynx. It was possible to identify the words in 80 percent of
      synthesized sentences.

                                      Beyond neuroprosthetics, biomachine interface innovations can be used to diagnose
                                      and treat a variety of diseases. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been used
                                      in conjunction with behavioral tests to assess whether patients have Alzheimer’s and
                                      Parkinson’s disease. 444 Other commonly used measures for understanding brain activity
                                      in order to diagnose disease include CT scans, MRIs, PETs, and SPECTs. 445 And innovative
                                      new biomachine interface–based healthcare approaches are now emerging such as deep
                                      brain stimulation.

      Deep brain stimulation
      DBS uses a device that sends pulses of electric current to help mitigate some of the effects
      of neurological diseases. 446 The technology was approved by the FDA in the United States
      in 1997 for treating essential tremor often observed in Parkinson’s, Parkinson’s itself in
      2002, and dystonia in 2003. 447 Research is ongoing into whether DBS can be applied to
      patients with Alzheimer’s, depression, and anxiety, conditions for which DBS has not yet
      been approved. 448

      Mental state monitoring as an aid to therapy
      In the future, more advanced brain signal-reading headsets or machines may emerge that
      can “read” patients’ emotional state and therefore be a useful aid in therapy. 449 In 2013,
      researchers at Carnegie Mellon University were able to use functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) and a machine learning algorithm to calibrate a machine that recognizes
      the emotions test subjects were experiencing with reasonable accuracy. 450 If this technique is
      refined, there is potential to use it to assist in therapy sessions.


      Biomachine interfaces have consumer applications from wellness to
      advanced gaming devices
      A number of biomachine interface prototypes for consumer applications have emerged,
      generating intense interest in the prospect of brain control. We highlight applications in
      wellness, consumer devices, and pets and pet care.

      Wellness
      Consumer interest in health wearables such as stress-monitoring headbands is growing. One
      of the earliest available consumer biomachine interfaces that interpreted EEG signals was
      the Muse headband, which began development in 2003 and was released commercially in
      2014. 451 A team of Canadian neuroscientists spent a week in the Mars Habitat at the Hawaii
      Space Exploration Analog and Simulation to explore options for monitoring the brain health of
      astronauts on future Mars missions in real time, and used the Muse headband. 452

      Wearable headsets could potentially interpret EEG signals in a basic way to describe stress
      levels for users and then use the information to test and optimize the ergonomic design of
      spaces such as aircraft cockpits to minimize stress and optimize cognitive performance. At
      ISAE-SUPAERO (the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space), researchers
      are using simple neuroergonomics to speed up pilots’ reactions to warning systems, cutting
      reaction times by one-third. Neuropriming for athletic performance and potentially mental
      conditioning is another application. This technology involves applying transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS), or noninvasive and pain-free electric currents delivered from
      a headset, to a user’s brain prior to starting a workout; the stimulation primes the brain to
      establish neuronal connections that optimize athletic performance. 453 While tDCS has been
      used in the clinical treatment of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s, Halo
      Neuroscience is one of a number of startups interested in taking the scientific principles of
      the clinical treatment and applying it to consumer devices. Its Halo headset primes the user’s
      brain for 20 minutes before starting a workout.

Hypothetically, if neuroprosthetics are able to feed light signals to the optic nerve, it would
also be possible to transmit other signals, like infrared, to augment vision even in individuals
with 20/20 vision. French company Pixium Vision and Stanford University have produced
infrared bionic vision implants. A microprocessor embedded in the eye takes infrared light and
then translates it as electrical stimulation to underlying optic nerve cells; infrared light is used
because signals from ambient light are not strong enough to be detected. 454

Consumer devices
A number of consumer applications of biomachine interfaces could be promising. In gaming,
the Emotiv headset collects users’ brain signals and then assesses and calibrates them
to control a simple action such as lifting an object. 455 Hypothetically, brain-wave-reading
technologies could control phones and computers. Most likely to be commercialized for
consumer use is using brain control for augmented reality (AR) wearables such as smart
glasses. 456 Demand for brain-controlled devices may be limited because there are, for
now, easier forms of control such as eye tracking and even conventional touch-based
smartphones; this may mean that investment is not forthcoming to power advances in
this area. Wearable headsets could be used in marketing to collect consumers’ reactions
to different products and retail channels. Current technologies would support very basic
interpretations, such as levels of stress or excitement. In the future, theoretically headsets
could be used to interpret brain signals of pets in a bid to understand their mental and
emotional state.


Biomachine interfaces may develop in defense
Potential biomachine applications in defense could hypothetically include using brain-to-
brain communications on the battlefield or integrated exoskeletons with extra appendages
that are controllable via neural connection. In March 2018, Darpa announced a four-year
Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology program, known as N3, with $20 million
allocated to six teams at different universities and research centers to develop cutting-edge
biomachine interfaces. 457 The project goals are truly straight from science fiction. One project
group is looking at ways to genetically engineer brain cells to develop iron-activated proteins
that emit infrared light, which can then be manipulated by magnetic headsets to stimulate
specific cells with the hope of conveying images into the brain. While such projects are highly
speculative, they illustrate growing interest in the military and defense industry in how to use
emerging technology.

6.7. Biocomputing

   Molecular biology and modern computer science are interacting in a dynamic way to create
   entire new functionalities, including the birth of biocomputing. We define biocomputing
   as technologies that use biological molecules to perform data and analytics functions
   traditionally achieved in silicon-based devices. For Silicon Valley and other global tech
   centers, some regard this as the new technological frontier; biocomputing was the final topic
   of the keynote speech at Microsoft’s Ignite conference in 2019. 458

   The two main applications of biocomputing explored in this chapter are nucleic acid data
   storage and biology-based parallel processing. 459 Commercially usable nucleic acid storage
   could technically be available after 2025, but it would be rudimentary and not likely to have
   significant commercial impact in this time frame. By 2050 to 2075, the technology could have
   potential direct annual impact of between roughly $5 billion and $15 billion. Biology-based
   parallel computing is not likely to become commercially viable for several decades. There
   has been progress in proof-of-concept demonstrations, but substantial challenges must be
   faced before these technologies can compete with silicon devices and be commercialized.
   It may well be that, even in the long term, biocomputing will complement rather than
   replace silicon. 460


   There is potential in biological storage and computing
   We look at two types of applications in biocomputing: nucleic acid data storage and biology-
   based parallel computing.

   Nucleic acid data storage
   Nucleic acid data storage is data storage in strands of DNA. (Using RNA for storage is
   possible, but DNA is more stable.) Today, data are stored on semiconductor and magnetic
   devices, but imagine a future in which automated machines store information by synthesizing
   strands of DNA; the base pairs could encode text, pictures, and even movies. A section of
   DNA where the data are stored would need to be identified, the pairs read, and the data
   returned to your computer. Because it is—for now—harder to manipulate base pairs in
   order to store data biologically than to use conventional silicon-based information storage,
   it is highly likely that nucleic acid data storage will not replace conventional data storage
   altogether, but instead be used in cases involving large quantities of data that do not need to
   be accessed quickly.

   This may sound far-fetched, but the application is on its way. The first encoding of
   a 659-kilobyte book on DNA was carried out in 2011 at Harvard University, and the next
   year the team demonstrated far higher accuracy and much more data stored—more than
   five megabytes. 461 In 2013, the European Bioinformatics Institute reported accuracy of

         Simson Garfinkel, “Biological computing,” MIT Technology Review, May 1, 2000.
   460
         Two other emerging technologies are worth mentioning that are not in the scope of our analysis. The first is neuromorphic
         computing, which is the application of brain-based principles of gradient signals to traditional circuits. See Scott Fulton
         III, What neuromorphic engineering is, and why it’s triggered an analog revolution, ZDNet, February 2019. Unlike the
         applications we investigate that use biological substrates, neuromorphic computing uses biological principles from
         studying the brain to create more advanced version of silicon-based electronics. The second emerging technology is bio-
         nanorobotics and biologic reactors, or the use of biochemical properties of molecules or cells to detect environmental
         signals and transduce certain actions. Unlike the applications we investigate, the most direct use of this application
         would be acting as an element of bio-nanorobotic engineering. In the distant future, bio-nanorobotic computers may
         emerge. See Simson Garfinkel, “Biological computing,” MIT Technology Review, May 1, 2000.

      100 percent. 462 Now private-sector companies, including Intel, Micron, and Microsoft, are
      investing in this technology.

      Advances in this area could be one way to solve the rising challenge of how to store all
      the data now being generated. Every minute, 16 million texts are sent and more than half
      a million photos shared via Snapchat. Every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced
      globally. 463 Some estimates suggest that the world could run out of silicon for data storage by
      2040. 464 DNA storage presents a potential solution because DNA is extremely compact. DNA
      is about a million times denser than conventional hard-disk storage; technically, engineering
      constraints aside, one kilogram of DNA could store all of the world’s data today. 465 Another
      property of nucleic acid data storage is the longevity of the medium given the right storage
      conditions. 466 Nucleic acid data storage could ensure that any data not regularly accessed
      could be stored safely and securely in the very long term—on the scale of dozens or even
      hundreds of years. 467

      Realistically, however, significant challenges must be overcome before nucleic acid storage
      can be used commercially. First, the cost of storage currently is prohibitively high, both in
      synthesizing (writing) and sequencing (reading) the data. Encoding a single megabyte of data
      via DNA cost $3,500 in 2017, compared with 2 cents on a hard disk. 468 Costs could come down
      rapidly, as they have with silicon storage—a megabyte of DNA cost $12,400 to code in 2012.

      A second challenge is the current lack of a distributable automated system to write and read,
      and then access, nucleic acid data. Organizations or corporations hosting these data would
      need equipment capable of converting them directly from electronically stored data into DNA
      molecules. This requires complex fluid dynamics engineering for accurate DNA synthesis.
      This challenge is not, however, insurmountable. Recent research indicates that there has
      already been significant progress. A collaboration between the University of Washington and
      Microsoft demonstrated an end-to-end automated version of the process in 2019 that links
      the writing and reading functions directly to a computer—no handling of DNA in pipettes was
      necessary. 469 A final challenge is that DNA data storage is still not as fast as electronic data
      storage despite continuing advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and this prevents
      timely recording and extraction of data. Current DNA synthesis techniques take about 400
      seconds to add each base pair, compared with almost instantaneous coding of 0 or 1 in
      conventional silicon-based computing. A typical hard disk drive has read/write speeds of up
      to 200 megabits per second. 470

      Biology-based parallel computing
      In the future, a biologic parallel computer may use biomolecules to test many solutions in
      parallel simultaneously, and therefore come up with an answer much more quickly than
      traditional computing. Biology-based parallel computing broadly uses designed molecules
      or cells as analogs for solutions or logic operations, thereby creating new algorithmic
      approaches for solving problems that rely on biologic substrates.

The advantages of this application are greater energy efficiency and speed. Researchers at
McGill University created a chip with microscopic channels coated with myosin, a molecular
motor found in muscle cells, through which protein filaments were able to travel. 471 By
configuring the device’s layout, researchers were able to set up the “traveling salesman
problem” in which the algorithmically complex question is asked, “What is the best route to
take to visit all locations at least once, while returning to the starting location?” Whereas
a traditional computing approach would require testing every single possible solution out
of the numerous possible routes, with the protein-based parallel computation method,
the proteins’ final exit channels showed answers to optimized travel routes more quickly than
conventional computing would. 472 Furthermore, the biocomputing chip identified the answer
while using 10,000 times less energy than a traditional computer in solving the same problem.
While the proof-of-concept experiments tackled simple problems that had less space to
demonstrate calculation speed, researchers strongly believe that future complex problems
that would be difficult or even impossible to solve with traditional computing could be more
quickly calculated by parallel processing biocomputing.

Interest in this nascent area is growing. As part of EU Horizon 2020, its flagship innovation
plan, the EU launched a five-year project called Bio4Comp in 2017 with an initial investment
of €6.1 million that aims to create a biocomputer prototype. DNA storage is attracting interest
from governments and defense departments. For instance, Darpa has made $15.3 million of
grants to players investigating DNA storage. 473

Technical appendix
This appendix provides additional details on the key assumptions, calculations, methods, and
data sources used to estimate the potential direct economic impact of biological applications.
It comprises the following sections:

— Scope and factors in our estimations of potential economic impact

— Methodology for micro-to-macro analysis based on use cases

— Methodology for extrapolation of potential economic impact in different time horizons

— Methodology for estimating the timing of the adoption acceleration point




Scope and factors in our estimations of potential economic impact
Our analysis is not a forecast or prediction of future value created, but rather a set of
estimates of the potential for economic impact of bio innovation given certain assumptions.
All assessments are annual and global, and include only direct impact based on a library
of about 400 use cases. Our estimates assume that there are no global regulatory bans
on the technologies included in our scope and that R&D continues. These estimates are
particularly sensitive to assumptions about adoption rates and to the value of different types
of gains, including, for instance, improved outcomes in health, and cost savings in a number
of domains.

We sized only direct impact biological applications that are scientifically conceivable
today and could plausibly be adopted by 2050
We estimated direct impact from the library of around 400 use cases we identified. To compile
the library, we first defined which technologies fell within the scope of the Bio Revolution
as defined in this research. We then identified a pipeline of applications that could produce
tangible benefits. The library includes use cases that are scientifically conceivable today
and could plausibly be adopted by 2050. It excludes applications that are not scientifically
conceivable today (for instance, steel production via biological means) or are unlikely to have
material commercial impact by 2050. All technologies described in chapter 1 are included. We
excluded technologies that are already commercially mature. We tested the use cases with
a range of experts to better understand economic potential and adoption timing.

For applications that are fully based on technologies included in our use cases, such as gene
therapy, we have estimated the entire potential direct economic impact. In cases where
existing technologies are improved, such as optimizing fermentation processes, we sized
the marginal benefit. So, for instance, we estimated the impact of enhanced production of
protein biologics with new genomic-related technologies, but not the impact on health of all
protein-based biologics at large. 474




474
      We do not consider protein-based biologics in the scope of our research, although they are biological in nature.

      This library is extensive, but not exhaustive. We acknowledge that other use cases may have
      an impact that we cannot identify today. For instance, there are applications that we cannot
      identify today due to limited public information—many innovations are being developed in
      private labs or in the defense industry where confidentiality is a major factor. In addition, while
      we sought input from a wide range of experts, that input was not exhaustive. Unforeseen
      breakthroughs in biological science and technology could unlock additional economic impact
      or accelerate scientific research and commercialization timelines. The visibility of the pipeline
      of future applications differs among domains. For instance, the human health pipeline is
      clearer because health is a heavily regulated public good. The path ahead for novel materials
      and chemicals, which are largely being developed by private-sector players that want to
      maintain confidentiality, is less visible.

      In some instances, we describe potential uses but do not estimate the potential size of
      their impact, largely because an application is unlikely to be commercialized by 2050; one
      example is biology-based parallel computing. We nevertheless chose to discuss such use
      cases qualitatively to demonstrate the potential breadth of biological applications. In some
      rare instances, including biocomputing, the commercialization timeline was difficult to
      assess, and estimating the size of the potential economic impact required unavailable data,
      methodologies, or both. In these cases, too, we confined ourselves to a qualitative discussion.

      Estimates of potential direct economic impact are relative to the 2020 economy and
      not forecasts
      We estimated potential direct economic impact for the future relative to the 2020 economy,
      including metrics such as global population and disease burden. This approach enables us to
      make comparisons of the magnitude of that economic impact without introducing additional
      scenarios based on variables such as future population growth, demographic shifts, inflation,
      changes in market size, or changes in the disease burden. Data sources for the 2020
      context include population estimates from the United Nations, disease burden estimates
      from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), and market-size estimates from
      market reports. We note that our estimates are likely to underestimate the value of markets
      that are growing and to overestimate cases where disease burden could be reduced or even
      eradicated by other means, for instance certain infectious diseases.

      We recognize that economic impact may not necessarily translate into GDP
      We assessed the annual potential economic impact from the perspective of the overall
      economy, including all participants in the value chain. Our estimates do not represent GDP
      or market size, but rather economic impact, including consumer surplus. We also note that
      we did not subtract R&D investment and development costs from value gains because we
      assumed they are already priced into the benefits.


      Methodology for micro-to-macro analysis based on use cases
      We grouped the library of around 400 use cases into 130-plus broader application categories
      in order to estimate their potential direct economic impact. Each assessment of applications
      was the product of three factors: volume, adoption rate, and value gained.

      — Volume. As noted, volume is based on 2020 metrics for population, markets, and
        the global burden of disease, for instance.

      — Adoption rate. For each application category, we ranged both adoption levels (low and
        high values that are ambitious but achievable) and timing of adoption to reflect a high level
        of uncertainty regarding adoption rate. Where possible, we used sector-specific analogs
        for potential adoption levels and timing, and we tested our assumptions with experts. We
        took geography into account in our assumptions on the timing of adoption, differentiating
        between high-income and low-income countries.

— Estimating value gained. For purposes of comparison, we estimated value for different
  types of gains in economic terms in the following main categories:

      • Cost productivity. We defined cost productivity as the reduction in cost required to
        produce or purchase an existing product or service.

      • Improvements in quality. In order to estimate the value of products and services that
        offer greater benefits, such as improved quality, than current alternatives, we estimated
        the additional value of these new products and services by customers’ willingness to
        pay a price premium. We then scaled this to current spending levels in the product or
        service category.

      • Health improvements. We translated impact on health into economic terms by looking at
        a reduction in the global disease burden that could be delivered by increasing efficacy
        of health treatments. Our calculation is not based on health spending or the sizes of
        pharmaceutical markets, but rather the potential economic impact experienced by all
        participants in the value chain. Our estimate does not account for cost of technologies.
        Efficacy refers to the percentage of intended disease reduction achieved when
        an intervention is adopted. We used current research on diagnostics and therapies
        to inform our assumptions on efficacy rates. We measured the disease burden using
        disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), primarily taken from 2017 data on the Global
        Burden of Disease compiled by IHME. The DALY measure includes years lived with
        disability (based on the number of individuals living with disease in that year) and
        years of life lost (the entirety of life for those dying in a year from a disease). In cases
        where DALY data were not available, we extrapolated from available metrics such as
        the percentage of births where monogenic disease was present. To translate reduced
        disease burden into economic metrics, we applied GDP-based values for high- and low-
        income countries. 475

         This methodology enabled us to size applications very broadly, but we acknowledge
         that it has some limitations. We did not, as noted, project changes in the burden of
         disease, but rather assumed a steady state. We acknowledge that this may mean that
         we underestimate the economic impact of diseases that are imposing a growing burden
         and overestimate the economic impact of diseases that may be eradicated, including
         certain infectious diseases. We also note that by valuing the entirety of life lost in
         the year in which a death occurs, we include potential that is not realized until later. This
         also assumes that an individual saved from one illness does not develop another that
         causes premature death or disability.

      • Environmental benefit. We defined this as the reduction of carbon emissions valued
        using the cost of carbon credits. 476 Some applications, including alternative (animal-free)
        proteins, reduce emissions, while others sequester existing carbon in the atmosphere.
        Given conservative adoption rates for both, we do not have concerns about double
        counting. One limitation of this methodology is using a single carbon credit value at
        a time when there is no universal, uniform carbon tax in place. Another is the fact that it
        does not account for other environmental benefits such as reduced use of water, land,
        and energy use, or the preservation of natural resources, which we did not factor into
        our sizing.




475
      Based on 2017 World Bank data on per capita GDP by country. We calculated weighted averages by population to match
      the IHME’s Global Burden of Disease country categories of high and low socio-demographic index (SDI). The resulting
      assumptions are approximately $23,000 per DALY for high-SDI countries and $4,000 per DALY for low-SDI countries.
      We made one exception; for use cases related to gene drives in lower-income countries, we assumed $1,000 per DALY.
476
      For consistency, we used the 2019 California price per metric ton of CO 2, $15.

      Methodology for extrapolation of potential economic impact in different
      time horizons
      In each application category, we estimated low and high levels of peak adoption—the level at
      which adoption plateaus when a product or service is mature. We also estimated the time it
      may take to reach peak adoption. This is a simplification that allows us to arrive at a feasible
      estimate of the potential economic impact; we recognize that adoption peak levels could
      change with shifting product features, customer demographics, and so on.

      Using expert input and historical analogs, we extrapolated our assessed impact to different
      time horizons by estimating how long it might take for an application to achieve scientific
      feasibility, commercial availability, and then peak impact. 477 We acknowledge that adoption
      levels and timing may be subject to many uncertainties, including shifting product features
      and customer demographics, that may not be fully captured in our assessment. Adoption was
      modeled based on innovation-adoption curves that varied depending on the type of use case
      to allocate the impact to different time horizons.

      We based our assessment of the time to peak impact for each application category on
      three components: time to scientific feasibility, time from scientific feasibility to commercial
      availability, and time from commercial availability to peak adoption (Exhibit A1).

      — Scientific feasibility. We defined this as experimental success in the target population
        (for instance, in the case of human health, success in humans rather than in mice models).
        For applications where we could not identify proof of concept in academia or industry, we
        assessed feasibility using sector-specific analogs and expert interviews that estimate
        how far away scientific feasibility might be.

      — Commercial availability. We defined this as the market launch of a product or service
        by at least one startup or incumbent (we recognize that true commercial availability
        includes profitability and a favorable regulatory environment). For applications where
        we could not identify commercial availability in this way, we estimated the potential time
        required from scientific feasibility to commercialization based on historical analogs and
        expert interviews.

      — Peak adoption. We defined peak adoption as the point at which product or service
        adoption plateaus. Given that none of the applications we assessed have reached peak
        adoption, we used sector-specific historical analogs for other innovations to assess
        the potential time from commercial availability to peak adoption.

      Based on the timelines assessed, we then allocated potential economic impact for each
      micro-assessment to different periods of interest based on a standardized adoption curve
      matching historical analogs. The periods for impact discussed throughout the report are
      the short term (2020 to 2030), medium term (2030 to 2040), and long term (2040 to 2050).




      477
            We recognize that not all bio innovations will be launched into a traditional “commercial” market, for instance those that
            are deployed by the public sector. We use “commercial availability” and “market launch” to refer to the general idea that
            the bio innovation has passed sufficient testing that it can now be made available to the target population, in which case
            the diffusion factors apply, for instance, whether the innovation is superior to alternatives.

                                       Methodology for estimating the timing of the adoption acceleration point
                                       Once the adoption curves for individual micro-assessments are generated, we determined
                                       the timing of the growth point of adoption—the point at which adoption grows most rapidly—
                                       using the widely used Everett Rogers theory on diffusion and adoption of technological
                                       innovations (Exhibit A2). 478 We referred to this point as the “acceleration point,” since it is
                                       where the second derivative of the sigmoid function for adoption reaches its maximum.
                                       Empirically, we observe that the successful adoption of an innovation generally follows
                                       an S-shaped sigmoid function curve. According to the theory, after 10 to 25 percent of
                                       a system’s members adopt an innovation, adoption by the remainder is relatively rapid.
                                       In order to understand and compare relative adoption across time periods for various
                                       applications, we identified the acceleration point for each application based on its modeled
                                       adoption curve. We used the timing of this acceleration point to determine over what
                                       timeframe adoption might be expected to increase at a rapid rate.

Glossary
The definitions in this glossary come from a range of online sources, including research
publications, scientific articles, and encyclopedias.

Allele. Any of the alternative forms of a gene that may occur at a given locus.

Bioinformatics. A hybrid science between computer science, biology, and statistics that
involves the analysis of large amounts of biological data.

Biocomputing. This field of biology is defined as using cells and cellular components for
computational processes (storing, retrieving, processing data).

Biomachine interfaces. This field of biology is defined as the connection of nervous systems
of living organisms to machines, including in brain-machine interfaces.

Biomarkers. A measurable indicator such as a molecule, gene, or characteristic, by which
a particular biological process can be identified.

Biomolecules. In our definition of biomolecules for this report, this covers the mapping and
measuring of intra-cellular components (for example, DNA, RNA, and proteins) in the study
of omics. We also include the engineering of intra-cellular components (for instance,
genome editing).

Biosystems. This covers engineering at the cell, tissue, or organ level, including stem-cell
technologies and transplantation use cases.

Carrier screening. Carrier screening is a genetic test used to determine if a healthy
person is a carrier of a recessive genetic disease. It provides life-lasting information about
an individual’s reproductive risk and their chances of having a child with a genetic disease.

CAR T-cell (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell). CAR T-cells are genetically engineered
T-cells which express artificial chimeric antigen receptors on their surface. These engineered
T-cells enable a patient’s own immune system to identify and destroy targeted cells.

Cell-free DNA/RNA analysis. Often abbreviated to cfDNA/cfRNA, this is the sequencing of
DNA or RNA outside a cell, in the bloodstream, for instance.

Checkpoint inhibitor. A type of drug that helps to activate a patient’s immune system. This
works by blocking immune checkpoint proteins that are involved in deactivating a patient’s
immune response.

CRISPR-Cas9. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-
associated protein 9. This tool uses a small piece of RNA with a short “guide” sequence
that attaches to a target sequence of DNA and to the Cas9 enzyme. The Cas9 enzyme cuts
the targeted DNA at the targeted location, which enables genetic material to be added
or deleted.

CRISPR-Chip. A system that immobilizes CRISPR complexes on the surface of graphene-
based transistors, which allows for the electronic identification of specific target genes.

Cultured meat. Meat produced by in vitro cultivation of animal cells.

      DNA. Short for deoxyribonucleic acid, this is an organic chemical found in all cells and in many
      viruses. DNA acts as the main carrier for genetic information.

      EEG. Short for electroencephalogram, this technique records brain wave patterns. It works by
      attaching small metal discs to the scalp to measure electrical activity.

      ELISA. Short for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, this technique detects and measures
      the amount of a substance in a solution such as serum. It uses antibodies linked to enzymes
      that can produce a color change or other measurable effect.

      Epigenomics. This is the study of the epigenome, specifically epigenetic modifications
      that affect gene expression such as DNA methylation and histone modification. This can
      direct such actions as turning genes on or off, and controlling the production of proteins in
      particular cells.

      Fermentation. This is an anaerobic metabolic process in which energy can be released
      from carbohydrate (such as glucose) even if oxygen is not available. During this process,
      the carbohydrate is converted into alcohol or acid. Fermentation occurs in yeast cells,
      bacteria, and the muscle cells of animals.

      Flow cytometry. A laser-based technology that counts, sorts, and profiles cells or particles
      within a liquid suspension.

      Gene array. Scientific equipment that contains a collection of nucleic acids at specific
      locations, which allows for measurement of analysis of the nucleic acids.

      Gene drive. Technology that uses genetic engineering to enable a specific genetic variant to
      be passed from parent to child at a higher-than-normal rate (up to 100 percent).

      Genome sequencing. A process for determining the order of DNA nucleotides within
      a DNA sequence.

      Genome-wide association studies. These studies find associations between a particular
      human trait and variation in genetic sequence throughout the genome across a large
      population. In these studies, people who have a particular disease and many who don’t are
      sequenced in order to find areas of consistent differences. If such areas are discovered, this
      helps scientists to zero in on parts of the genome that are responsible for the risk of disease.

      Genomics. This is the study of genes and their functions, and techniques related to them.
      The genome consists of the full genetic complement of an organism—its DNA.

      Genotype. An organism’s collection of genetic material.

      Germline editing. This is gene editing of an embryo, egg, or sperm such that changes are
      inherited by all future generations.

      Glycomics. This relates to the glycome, which is the structure and function of the complete
      set of glycosylated products.

      GMO (genetically modified organism). A GMO is an organism whose genetic material
      has been altered or modified. In GM crops, DNA from foreign organisms such as bacteria
      is introduced.

      Guide RNAs or gRNAs. RNA sequences that guide Cas nuclease to a target region of DNA.

High-performance liquid chromatography. This is a form of column chromatography that
separates, identifies, and quantifies components dissolved in a liquid solvent with a high
analytical resolution.

In utero gene editing. This is editing of genes in a fetus while in the uterus, which has
the advantage of being able to use the normal developmental properties of the fetus to
accomplish efficient gene editing.

In vitro fertilization (IVF). A type of assisted reproduction technology in which an egg is
fertilized by sperm outside the body.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These are adult cells (for instance, skin cells) that
are reprogrammed into an embryonic stem cell-like state that enables the development of
unlimited amounts of any type of human cells.

Lipidomics. This is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete set of

fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG). This is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique for direct
mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields generated by electrical currents occurring
naturally in the neurons of the brain.

Marker-assisted breeding. Marker-assisted breeding uses DNA markers associated with
desirable traits to enable breeders to select a trait of interest without using transgenic
approaches. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding doesn’t produce GM organisms.

Mass spectrometry. This is a tool used for measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of one or
more molecules present in a sample. Mass spectrometers can be used to identify unknown
compounds by determining their molecular weight, to quantify known compounds, and to
determine the structure and chemical properties of molecules. It is used in epigenomics,
proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and microbiomics.

Mesenchymal stem cells. These are stem cells that are found in various tissues (such as
bone marrow) that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, such as bone, cartilage,
muscle, and fat.

Metabolomics. This is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete
set of metabolites (substrates, intermediates, and products of metabolism) of a biological
system (cell, tissue, organ, biological fluid, or organism) at a specific point in time.

Microarray. This is a high-throughput screening method where the DNA sequences
representing the large number of genes of an organism that are arranged in a grid pattern for
detection in genetic testing.

Microbiomics. This is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete
set of microbes (the microbiome) of a biological system (such as the human gut or skin, and in
the soil around farms) at a specific point in time.

Monoclonal antibodies. These are man-made antibodies of predetermined specificity
against targets made by identical immune cells derived from a unique parent cell.

      Neuroergonomics. This is a research field that investigates the human brain functions—
      perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions—in relation to behavioral performance in natural
      environments and everyday settings.

      Neuroprosthetics. Hybrid bionic systems that link the human nervous system to computers,
      thereby providing motor control and restoring lost sensory function of artificial limbs.

      Next-generation sequencing (NGS). This is a catch-all term that refers to a range of modern
      high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies in which millions or billions of small DNA
      fragments can be sequenced in parallel. The sequences of these small fragments will be
      pieced together by mapping against the human reference genome.

      Noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT). Also known as noninvasive prenatal screening or NIPS,
      this is a noninvasive method for determining the risk that a fetus will be born with certain
      genetic disorders, primarily used for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, by
      analyzing small cell-free fetal DNA fragments circulating in a pregnant woman’s blood.

      Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. An analytical technique for determining
      molecular structures. Applications include determining the content and purity of a sample as
      well as its molecular structure, and metabolomics.

      Nucleotides. These are the chemical compounds that are the basic structural units of RNA
      and DNA.

      Omics. This is a collective term for technologies that allow the comprehensive identification
      and quantification of the complete set of molecules (eg, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids) of
      a biological system (cell, tissue, organ, biological fluid, or organism) at a specific point in time.

      Omics and molecular technologies. We define this term to cover the study of omics as well
      as technologies to engineer (design, synthesize, or modify) the same “omes.”

      Outcrossing. This is the transfer of genes from genetically engineered plants into
      conventional crops or related species in the wild.

      Phage. Also known as bacteriophage, this is a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria.

      Pharmacogenomics. This is the use of an individual’s genomic profile to optimize the choice
      of drugs and doses by physicians.

      Phenotype. This is an organism’s observable characteristics that could be influenced both by
      the genes of the organism and the environment.

      Polygenic. Polygenic diseases are caused by more than one gene. Examples of polygenic
      conditions include hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. There are often many
      environmental factors, too, making it more difficult to discern to what degree a disease is
      genetic even when the multiple genes are identified.

      Preimplantation genetic testing. This is genetic testing of an embryo prior to embryo
      transfer (to a uterus) during IVF. This can be done to test for single gene disorders such
      as cystic fibrosis (preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD) or overall chromosomal
      abnormalities such as Down syndrome caused by an extra chromosome (preimplantation
      genetic screening, or PGS).

      Proteomics. This is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete set
      of proteins of a biological system (cell, tissue, organ, biological fluid, or organism) at a specific
      point in time.

Regenerative medicine. The process of replacing, engineering, or regenerating human or
animal cells, tissues, or organs to restore or establish natural function.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A laboratory technique used
to make large-scale copies of specific segments of DNA molecules rapidly and precisely
outside the body from a mixture of DNA molecules.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA). A biopolymer consists of ribose nucleotides (nitrogenous bases
appended to a ribose sugar molecule) connected and forming strands of varying lengths.
Unlike most DNA molecules composed of two biopolymer strands, RNA typically is a single-
stranded biopolymer. RNA molecules play essential biological roles from translating genetic
information encoded in DNA molecules into the cellular structures and molecular machines
(ie, proteins) to regulating the activities of genes.

RNA interference (RNAi). This is an evolutionarily conserved gene silencing technique in
which specific genes can be regulated and suppressed at the RNA level.

Single-cell omics. Any of the omics study can be done at a single-cell level. Analyzing
a single cell makes it possible to discover mechanisms not seen when studying cells in bulk
where variable signals from a heterogenous collection of cells in a typical sample would be
averaged out.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA). Central to RNA interference, siRNA is a family of double-
stranded non-coding RNA molecules, with typical lengths of 20 to 25 base pairs that regulate
the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading
their mRNA transcripts, preventing translation.

Stem cell. A type of cell in a multicellular organism that has two capabilities: capable of self-
renewal by producing indefinitely more cells of the same type, and capable of giving rise to
many other kinds of cells in the body by differentiation.

Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN). TALEN are enzymes engineered
to enable targeted modification of any DNA sequence in a large range of organisms.

Transcriptomics. This is the comprehensive identification and quantification of the complete
set of RNA transcripts of a biological system (such as the human gut or skin, and in the soil
around farms) at a specific point in time.

Whole genome sequencing. This is a method for analyzing the entire DNA sequence of
an organism’s genome.

Zinc finger nuclease. A class of engineered proteins that bind DNA and create double strand
breaks at user-specified locations to facilitate targeted editing of the genome.
