Since its
About  MGIfounding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought
to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims
to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions.

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management,
employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic
industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces
affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have
covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets,
the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology
and innovation, and urbanization. Recent reports have assessed the
digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on employment, income
inequality, the productivity puzzle, the economic benefits of tackling gender
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and digital and
financial globalization.

MGI is led by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: Jacques Bughin,
Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika, who also serves as the chairman
of MGI. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, Jan Mischke,
Sree Ramaswamy, and Jaana Remes are MGI partners, and Mekala Krishnan
and Jeongmin Seong are MGI senior fellows.

Project teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows,
and include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These
teams draw on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and
management experts. The MGI Council, which includes leaders from
McKinsey offices around the world and the Firm’s sector practices,
includes Michael Birshan, Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, André Dua,
Kweilin Ellingrud, Tarek Elmasry, Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan,
Acha Leke, Scott Nyquist, Gary Pinkus, Sven Smit, Oliver Tonby, and
Eckart Windhagen. In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates,
advise MGI research.

The partners of McKinsey fund MGI’s research; it is not commissioned by any
business, government, or other institution. For further information about MGI

PREFACE

In 2014, the McKinsey Global Institute proposed a new way of looking at globalization: by
measuring global flows of goods, services, finance, and people. In 2016, we returned to
the topic, highlighting the contrast between flattening trade in physical goods and soaring
cross-border data flows. That report described a more digital form of globalization that has
opened the door to new participants, created new sources of value, and introduced new
opportunities and risks.*1

Today we take another look at how globalization is evolving, this time viewing it through the
lens of global value chains. Trade patterns are shaped by myriad business decisions within
these production networks, not by the simple act of one country choosing to buy less from
another. Using MGI’s signature “micro-to-macro” approach, we look at how companies
participating in 23 different industry value chains are responding to global opportunities and
pressures. We examine both goods-producing and service industries across 43 countries.
Our work also draws on interviews with dozens of industry experts, proprietary industry
data, and national accounts trade data. In addition to extending our previous work on global
flows and digital globalization, this report builds on a multiyear body of research by MGI
on topics that include manufacturing, corporate competition, global consumption trends,
technology, and automation as well as economic and labor market trends in specific regions
of the world.

This research was led by Susan Lund, an MGI partner based in Washington, DC;
James Manyika, MGI’s chairman, based in San Francisco; Jonathan Woetzel, an
MGI director based in Shanghai; Jacques Bughin, an MGI director based in Brussels;
Mekala Krishnan, an MGI senior fellow based in Boston; and Jeongmin Seong, an MGI
senior fellow based in Shanghai. The project team, led by Mac Muir, included Colin Britton,
Joana Carreiro, Diana Goldshtein, Rensyn Hooi, Sophie Jewsbury, Sue Jia, Prakriti Mishra,
Carlos Molina, Khalid Nadiri, Simisola Oyesanya, Jose Maria Quiros, and Saurav Tripathy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Even as tariffs dominate the headlines, important structural changes in the nature of
globalization have gone largely unnoticed. The global financial crisis and recession
obscured some of the shifts. Now, ten years on, our analysis of the dynamics of global value
chains in 23 industries reveals several transformations that have been hiding in plain sight.

To begin, although output and trade continue to increase in absolute terms, trade intensity
(that is, the share of output that is traded) is declining within almost every goods-producing
value chain. Flows of services and data now play a much bigger role in tying the global
economy together. Not only is trade in services growing faster than trade in goods, but
services are creating value far beyond what national accounts measure. Using alternative
measures, we find that services already constitute more value in global trade than goods.

In addition, all global value chains are becoming more knowledge-intensive. Low-skill labor
is becoming less important as factor of production. Contrary to popular perception, only
about 18 percent of global goods trade is now driven by labor arbitrage.

Three factors explain these changes: growing demand in China and the rest of the
developing world, which enables these countries to consume more of what they produce;
the development of more comprehensive domestic supply chains in those countries,
reducing their imports of intermediate goods; and the growing impact of new technologies.
In the past, digital technologies had one clear effect: they accelerated trade by reducing
transaction costs. Yet the next generation of technologies will have more complex,
multidimensional effects. In some scenarios, they could dampen trade in goods while
fueling further growth in services trade.

This report builds on previous McKinsey Global Institute research on global flows and digital
globalization.1 It analyzes 23 global value chains in both goods-producing and service
industries, spanning 43 countries, and extends the World Input-Output Database to cover
the years from 1995 to 2017. Together the value chains we highlight account for 96 percent
of global trade, 69 percent of global output, and 68 percent of global employment. We also
draw on dozens of interviews with industry experts, proprietary industry data, and national
accounts data.

Our findings reveal that globalization is in the midst of a transformation. Yet the public debate
about trade is often about recapturing the past rather than looking toward the future. The
mix of countries, companies, and workers that stand to gain in the next era is changing.
Understanding how the landscape is shifting will help policy makers and business leaders
prepare for globalization’s next chapter and the opportunities and challenges it will present.

                    WE GROUP GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS INTO SIX ARCHETYPES, WITH DISTINCT
                    CHARACTERISTICS AND TRADE PATTERNS
                    Global value chains reflect millions of decisions made by businesses regarding where to
                    source inputs, where to establish production, and where to sell goods. These decisions
                    shape the movement and volume of global flows of goods, services, finance, people, and
                    data. The simplest value chains, in industries such as basic metals, involve a sequence of
                    production steps that process inputs and raw commodities contributed by firms located
                    in different countries. The most complex, such as those for electronics, automobiles, and
                    aircraft, can involve hundreds of inputs from dozens of countries and subassembly of
                    complex components.2 Services are also delivered through value chains.3 Two-thirds of
                    world trade is in intermediate inputs, not final goods and services, underscoring the scale
                    and intricacy of these cross-border production networks.

                    We group industry value chains into six archetypes: four in goods-producing industries
                    and two in services (Exhibit E1). We classify them by their factor inputs, trade intensity, and
                    country participation. These groupings highlight important differences in dynamics.

                     Global innovations. Industries including automotive, computers and electronics, and
                       machinery have given rise to the most valuable, highly traded, and knowledge-intensive
                       of all goods-producing value chains. They account for 13 percent of gross output but
                       35 percent of trade. They involve many sequential steps and intricate components that
                       may require subassembly; in fact, just over half of all trade within these value chains
                       is in intermediate goods rather than finished products. One-third of the workforce in
                       these value chains is highly skilled, a share that is second only to knowledge-intensive
                       services. Spending on R&D and intangible assets averages 30 percent of revenues, two
                       to three times the figure in other value chains. Participation in these value chains is highly
                       concentrated in a small set of advanced economies, although China’s role is growing. On
                       average, just 12 countries account for 75 percent of exports.

                     Labor-intensive goods. These value chains, including textiles and apparel, toys, shoes,
                       and furniture, are highly labor- and trade-intensive. More than two-thirds of income
                       goes to labor, most of which is low-skill. Given their light weight, the products in these
                       industries are highly tradable, and 28 percent of global output is exported. Production
                       shifted to developing countries in the last wave of globalization, and those countries
                       today account for 62 percent of trade, a larger share than in any other archetype.
                       Although these value chains are synonymous in many minds with “globalization,” they
                       represent only 3 percent of global gross output and employ only 3 percent of the global
                       workforce (100 million people). China is the largest producer, but new manufacturing
                       technologies and changes in demand are likely to shift country participation in the future.

                     Regional processing. Industries in this archetype include fabricated metals; rubber
                       and plastics; glass, cement, and ceramics; and food and beverage. These value chains
                       use relatively few intermediate goods. But with the exception of food and beverage,
                       more than two-thirds of the output they produce becomes intermediate input feeding
                       into other value chains, particularly global innovations. For instance, 82 percent of
                       output in fabricated metal products and 74 percent of output in paper and printing are
                       intermediate goods. The defining feature of regional processing is low tradability, due
                       to the weight, bulk, or perishability of the goods produced. Production is therefore

                                distributed around the world, with many countries (including developing economies)
                                participating and a high share of intraregional trade (56 percent). However, trade is
                                growing faster in these value chains than in the global innovations or labor-intensive
                                goods archetypes. These value chains account for 9 percent of global gross output and
                                employ 169 million people, or 5 percent of the global labor force. These value chains are
                                often overlooked, given their relatively low value added per worker, but they are essential
                                industries in all economies.

                             Resource-intensive goods. This archetype includes agriculture, mining, energy, and
                               basic metals. These value chains generate $20 trillion of gross output annually, nearly as
                               much as global innovations value chains. Much of this output goes to other value chains
                               as intermediate input. In the case of mining and basic metals, all output is intermediate
                               goods. Access to natural resources and proximity to storage and transportation
                               infrastructure determine where production is located. Countries around the world
                               participate; 19 countries account for 75 percent of resource-intensive goods exports.
                               The top five countries make up a lower share of exports in this group than in any other, at
                               just 29 percent. While agriculture employs almost 870 million people globally, the other
                               value chains in this archetype employ only 49 million people in total, or 1.5 percent of the
                               global workforce. Resource-intensive value chains contribute 11 percent of global value
                               added, the highest share among all goods-producing value chains. Mining and energy
                               have the highest value added per employee among all the value chains we studied.

                             Labor-intensive services. These value chains include retail and wholesale,
                               transportation and storage, and healthcare. Given the in-person nature of these services,
                               trade intensity is low, but trade is growing faster than in any other archetype. Trade in
                               transportation services, for example, has increased with the rise of goods trade, tourism,
                               and business travel; rising trade in wholesale and retail reflects the global expansion of
                               retailers such as Carrefour and Walmart. These value chains are the largest job creators
                               after agriculture, employing more than 740 million people (23 percent of the global
                               workforce), two-thirds of whom are in wholesale and retail trade. While often overlooked
                               by policy makers, these sectors are an important part of the economy in all countries.
                               Their value added per employee is the same as in labor-intensive manufacturing (roughly
                               $25,000), and they employ seven times as many people.

                             Knowledge-intensive services. These high-value industries include professional
                               services, financial intermediation, and IT services. More than half of the people employed
                               in knowledge-intensive services have bachelor’s degrees or above. Although they would
                               seem to be inherently unconstrained by geography, these value chains have lower trade
                               intensity than goods-producing industries, largely due to regulatory barriers. The trade
                               flows that do occur span the entire globe since costs are not directly related to distance.
                               Country participation is highly concentrated in advanced economies; just 21 percent of
                               all exports in this category come from developing economies, the lowest share among
                               all types of value chains. The high concentration among countries reflects the significant
                               investment in a skilled workforce and intangible assets required to succeed in these
                               value chains.

                            GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS ARE UNDERGOING FIVE STRUCTURAL SHIFTS
                            The 1990s and 2000s saw the expansion of complex value chains spanning the globe. But
                            production networks are not immutable; they continue to evolve. We observe five major
                            shifts in global value chains over the past decade.4 These shifts are occurring against
                            a backdrop of policy uncertainty (see Box E1, “The impact of trade tensions on global
                            value chains”).

                            1. Goods-producing value chains have grown less trade-intensive
                            Trade rose rapidly within nearly all global value chains from 1995 to 2007. More recently,
                            trade intensity (that is, the ratio of gross exports to gross output) in almost all goods-
                            producing value chains has fallen. Trade is still growing in absolute terms, but the share
                            of output moving across the world’s borders has fallen from 28.1 percent in 2007 to
                            22.5 percent in 2017. Trade volume growth has also slowed. Between 1990 and 2007, global
                            trade volumes grew 2.1 times faster than real GDP on average, but they have grown only 1.1
                            times faster than GDP since 2011.5 The decline in trade intensity is especially pronounced
                            in the most complex and highly traded value chains (Exhibit E2). However, this trend does
                            not signal that globalization is over. Rather, it reflects the development of China and other
                            emerging economies, which are now consuming more of what they produce.

                            2. Services play a growing and undervalued role in global value chains
                            In 2017, gross trade in services totaled $5.1 trillion, a figure dwarfed by the $17.3 trillion
                            global goods trade. But trade in services has grown more than 60 percent faster than goods
                            trade over the past decade. Some subsectors, including telecom and IT services, business
                            services, and intellectual property charges, are growing two to three times faster.

                            Yet the full role of services is obscured in traditional trade statistics. First, services create
                            roughly one-third of the value that goes into traded manufactured goods.6 R&D, engineering,
                            sales and marketing, finance, and human resources all enable goods to go to market. In
                            addition, we find that imported services are substituting for domestic services in nearly all
                            value chains. In the future, the distinction between goods and services will continue to blur
                            as manufacturers increasingly introduce new types of leasing, subscription, and other “as a
                            service” business models.7

                                Throughout this report, we refer primarily to nominal trade and GDP values reflecting current exchange rates in
                                dollars. These values embody both quantity and prices.

                                    unpriced and untracked unless captured as intellectual property charges.8 Years of R&D go
                                    into developing pharmaceuticals and smartphones, for example, while design and branding
                                    enable companies such as Nike and Adidas to charge a premium for their products.9
                                    However, trade statistics do not capture the use of intangible assets in production and sales
                                    around the world.

                                    Finally, trade statistics do not track soaring cross-border flows of free digital services,
                                    including email, real-time mapping, video conferencing, and social media. Wikipedia, for
                                    instance, encompasses 40 million free articles in roughly 300 languages. Every day, users
                                    worldwide watch more than a billion hours of YouTube’s video content for free, and billions of
                                    people use Facebook and WeChat every month. These services undoubtedly create value
                                    for users, even without a monetary price.

                                    We estimate that these three channels collectively produce up to $8.3 trillion in value
                                    annually—a figure that would increase overall trade flows by $4.0 trillion (or 20 percent) and
                                    reallocate another $4.3 trillion currently counted as part of the flow of goods to services. If
                                    viewed this way, trade in services is already more valuable than trade in goods (Exhibit E3).10

Taking into account the undermeasured aspects of service flows, services account for more than half of value
added in overall trade.

                    This perspective would also substantially shift the trade balance for some countries,
                    most notably the United States. This exercise is not meant to argue for redefining national
                    trade statistics. It simply underscores the underappreciated role of services, which will be
                    increasingly important for how companies and countries participate in global value chains
                    and trade in the future.

                    3. Trade based on labor-cost arbitrage is declining in some value chains
                    As global value chains expanded in the 1990s and early 2000s, many decisions about
                    where to locate production were based on labor costs, particularly in industries producing
                    labor-intensive goods and services. Yet counter to popular perceptions, today only
                    18 percent of goods trade is based on labor-cost arbitrage (defined as exports from
                    countries whose GDP per capita is one-fifth or less than that of the importing country).11 In
                    other words, over 80 percent of today’s global goods trade is not from a low-wage country
                    to a high-wage country. Considerations other than low wages factor into company decisions
                    about where to base production. These include access to skilled labor or natural resources,
                    proximity to consumers, and the quality of infrastructure.

                    Moreover, the share of trade based on labor-cost arbitrage has been declining in some value
                    chains, especially labor-intensive goods manufacturing (where it dropped from 55 percent
                    in 2005 to 43 percent in 2017). This mainly reflects rising wages in developing countries.
                    In the future, however, automation and AI may amplify this trend, transforming labor-
                    intensive manufacturing into capital-intensive manufacturing. This shift will have important
                    implications for how low-income countries participate in global value chains.

                    4. Global value chains are growing more knowledge-intensive
                    Intangibles are playing a bigger role in global value chains. In all value chains, capitalized
                    spending on R&D and intangible assets such as brands, software, and intellectual property
                    (IP) is growing as a share of revenue. 12 Overall, it rose from 5.4 percent of revenue in
                    2000 to 13.1 percent in 2016. This trend is most apparent in global innovations value
                    chains. Companies in machinery and equipment spend 36 percent of revenue on R&D
                    and intangibles, while those in pharmaceuticals and medical devices average 80 percent
                    (Exhibit E4). The growing emphasis on knowledge and intangibles favors countries with
                    highly skilled labor forces, strong innovation and R&D capabilities, and robust intellectual
                    property protections.13

                    In many value chains, value creation is shifting to upstream activities, such as R&D and
                    design, and to downstream activities, such as distribution, marketing, and after-sales
                    services. The share of value generated by the actual production of goods is declining (in
                    part because offshoring has lowered the price of many goods).14 This trend is pronounced
                    in pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics, which have seen the rise of “virtual
                    manufacturing” companies that focus on developing goods and outsource their production
                    to contract manufacturers.

                         If we vary the ratio of GDP per capita of the exporter and importer from 2 to 10, we find that labor-cost
                         arbitrage ranges from 5 to 30 percent of overall global trade.

                         Some trade in intangible assets is captured in trade statistics through intellectual property royalties, which are
                         influenced by tax considerations. But the creation (rather than final ownership location) of intangible assets
                         takes place in countries with talent, legal protections, and innovation ecosystems.

                                 ONE OF THE FORCES RESHAPING VALUE CHAINS IS A CHANGE IN THE
                                 GEOGRAPHY OF GLOBAL DEMAND
                                 The map of global demand, once heavily tilted toward advanced economies, is being
                                 redrawn—and value chains are reconfiguring as companies decide how to compete in
                                 the many major consumer markets that are now dotted worldwide. According to current
                                 projections, emerging markets will consume almost two-thirds of the world’s manufactured
                                 goods by 2025, with products such as cars, building products, and machinery leading the
                                 way.15 By 2030, developing countries are projected to account for more than half of all global
                                 consumption (Exhibit E5). These nations continue to deepen their participation in global
                                 flows of goods, services, finance, people, and data.

By 2030, developing countries, led by China and emerging Asia, could account for more than half of
global consumption.

                                 The biggest wave of growth has been happening in China, although there have been recent
                                 signs of slowing. Previous MGI research highlighted China’s working-age population as
                                 one of the key global consumer segments; by 2030, they are projected to account for
                                 12 cents of every $1 of worldwide urban consumption.16 As it reaches the tipping point of
                                 having more millionaires than any other country in the world, China now represents roughly
                                 a third of the global market for luxury goods.17 In 2016, 40 percent more cars were sold in
                                 China than in all of Europe, and China also accounts for 40 percent of global textiles and
                                 apparel consumption.

                                 As consumption grows, more of what gets made in China is now sold in China (Exhibit E6).
                                 This trend is contributing to the decline in trade intensity. Within the industry value chains
                                 we studied, China exported 17 percent of what it produced in 2007. By 2017, the share of
                                 exports was down to 9 percent. This is on a par with the share in the United States but is
                                 far lower than the shares in Germany (34 percent), South Korea (28 percent), and Japan
                                 (14 percent). This shift has been largely obscured because the country’s output, imports,
                                 and exports have all been rising so dramatically in absolute terms. But overall, China is
                                 gradually rebalancing toward more domestic consumption.

Since 2007, trade intensity has fallen in China and other developing economies.

12              McKinsey Global Institute         Executive summary


                            The rising middle class in other developing countries is also flexing new spending power.
                            By 2030, the developing world outside of China is projected to account for 35 percent of
                            global consumption, with countries including India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and
                            the Philippines leading the way. In 2002, India, for example, exported 35 percent of its
                            final output in apparel, but by 2017, that share had fallen by half, to 17 percent, as Indian
                            consumers stepped up purchases.

                            Growing demand in developing countries also offers an opportunity for exporters in
                            advanced countries. Only 3 percent of exports from advanced economies went to China in
                            1995, but that share was up to 12 percent by 2017. The corresponding share going to other
                            developing countries grew from 20 to 29 percent. In total, advanced economies’ exports to
                            developing countries grew from $1 trillion in 1995 to $4.2 trillion in 2017. In the automotive
                            industry, Japan, Germany, and the United States send 42 percent of their car exports to
                            China and the rest of the developing world. In knowledge-intensive services, 45 percent of
                            all exports from advanced economies go to the developing world. The Asia–Pacific region is
                            already a top strategic priority for many Western brands.

                            THE RISE OF DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAINS IN CHINA AND OTHER EMERGING
                            ECONOMIES HAS ALSO DECREASED GLOBAL TRADE INTENSITY
                            China’s rapid growth has made it a major part of virtually every goods-producing global
                            value chain. Overall, it now accounts for 20 percent of global gross output, up from just
                            4 percent in 1995. In textiles and apparel, electrical machinery, and glass, cement, and
                            ceramics, it now produces nearly half of global output.

                            But as its economy has matured, China has moved beyond assembling imported inputs
                            into final products. It now produces many intermediate goods and conducts more R&D in
                            its own domestic supply chains. This is the second factor dampening global trade intensity
                            in goods. In computers and electronics, for instance, Chinese companies are developing
                            the kind of sophisticated smartphone chips that China once imported from advanced
                            economies. Building more vertically integrated domestic industries enables China to capture
                            more value added—and simultaneously bring jobs and economic development to its poorer
                            inland provinces.

                            Other developing countries are beginning to exhibit the same structural shifts seen in China,
                            although they are at earlier stages. In textiles and apparel, for instance, production networks
                            spanning multiple stages are consolidating within individual countries such as Vietnam,
                            Bangladesh, Malaysia, India, and Indonesia.

                            As a group, emerging Asia has become less reliant on imported intermediate inputs
                            for the production of goods than the rest of the developing world (8.3 percent versus
                            15.1 percent in 2017). By contrast, in developing Europe, where economic growth has
                            been slower, companies have continued to integrate into the supply chains of companies in
                            Western Europe.

                            The decline in trade intensity reflects growing industrial maturity in emerging economies.
                            Over time, their production capabilities and consumption are gradually converging
                            with those of advanced economies. Declining trade intensity in goods does not mean
                            globalization is over; rather, digital technologies and data flows are becoming the connective
                            tissue of the global economy.18

                     NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE CHANGING COSTS ACROSS GLOBAL
                     VALUE CHAINS
                     The explosive growth of cross-border data flows, highlighted in MGI’s previous research on
                     digital globalization, is ongoing. According to World Bank data, 45.8 percent of the world
                     is now online, up from just 20 percent a decade ago. The number of cellular subscriptions
                     worldwide now exceeds the planet’s population. From 2005 to 2017, the amount of cross-
                     border bandwidth in use grew 148 times larger. A torrent of communications and content
                     travels along these digital pathways—and some of this traffic reflects companies interacting
                     with foreign operations, suppliers, and customers.

                     Instant and low-cost digital communication has had one clear effect: lowering transaction
                     costs and enabling more trade flows. But the impact of next-generation technologies
                     on global flows of goods and services will not be as simple. Some advances, like digital
                     platforms, blockchain, and the Internet of Things, will continue to reduce transaction and
                     logistics costs.19 Others may reduce trade flows in some cases, either by changing the
                     economics and location of production or by changing the actual goods and services
                     demanded (Exhibit E7). The net impact is uncertain, but in some plausible scenarios,
                     the next wave of technology could dampen global goods trade while continuing to fuel
                     service flows.

                     Digital platforms, logistics technologies, and data-processing advances will
                     continue to reduce cross-border transaction costs and enable all types of flows
                     In goods-producing value chains, logistics costs can be substantial. Companies often lose
                     time and money to customs processing or delays in international payments. Three sets of
                     technologies will continue to reduce these frictions in the years ahead.

                     Digital platforms can bring together far-flung participants, making cross-border search and
                     coordination more efficient and enabling smaller businesses to participate. E-commerce
                     marketplaces have already enabled significant cross-border flows by aggregating huge
                     selections and making pricing and comparisons more transparent. Alibaba’s AliResearch
                     projects that cross-border B2C e-commerce sales will reach approximately $1 trillion by
                     2020. B2B e-commerce could be five or six times as large. While many of those transactions
                     may substitute for traditional offline trade flows, e-commerce could still spur some
                     $1.3 trillion to $2.1 trillion in incremental trade by 2030, boosting trade in manufactured
                     goods by 6 to 10 percent. Continued rapid growth in small-parcel trade would present a
                     challenge for customs processing, however.

                     Logistics technologies also continue to improve. The Internet of Things (IoT) can make
                     delivery services more efficient by tracking shipments in real time, and AI can route trucks
                     based on current road conditions. Automated document processing can speed goods
                     through customs. At ports, autonomous vehicles can unload, stack, and reload containers
                     faster and with fewer errors. Blockchain shipping solutions can reduce transit times and
                     speed payments. We calculate that new logistics technologies could reduce shipping and
                     customs processing times by 16 to 28 percent. By removing some of the frictions that slow
                     the movement of goods today, these technologies together could potentially boost overall
                     trade by 6 to 11 percent by 2030.20

McKinsey Global Institute           Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains                                            15


                     Automation and additive manufacturing change production processes and the
                     relative importance of inputs
                     Previous MGI research has found that roughly half of the tasks that workers are paid to do
                     could technically be automated, suggesting a profound shift in the importance of capital
                     versus labor across industries.21 The growing adoption of automation and advanced
                     robotics in manufacturing makes proximity to consumer markets, access to resources,
                     workforce skills, and infrastructure quality assume more importance as companies decide
                     where to produce goods. Companies are reconsidering location decisions as a result.

                     Service processes can also be automated by artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual agents.
                     The addition of machine learning to these virtual assistants means they can perform a
                     growing range of tasks. Companies in advanced economies are already automating some
                     customer support services rather than offshoring them. This could reduce the $160 billion
                     global market for business process outsourcing (BPO), now one of the most heavily traded
                     service sectors.

                     Additive manufacturing (3-D printing) could also influence future trade flows. Most experts
                     believe it will not replace mass production over the next decade; its cost, speed, and quality
                     are still limitations. But it is gaining traction for prototypes, replacement parts, toys, shoes,
                     and medical devices. While 3-D printing could reduce trade in some specific products
                     substantially, the drop is unlikely to amount to more than a few percentage points across
                     overall trade in manufactured goods by 2030. In some cases, additive manufacturing could
                     even spur trade by enabling customization.22

                     Overall, we estimate that automation, AI, and additive manufacturing could reduce global
                     goods trade by up to 10 percent by 2030, as compared to the baseline. However, this
                     reflects only the direct impact of these technologies on enabling production closer to end
                     consumers in advanced economies. It is also possible that these technologies could lead
                     to nearshoring and regionalization of trade instead of reshoring in advanced economies.
                     Moreover, developing countries could adopt these technologies to improve productivity and
                     retain production, thereby sustaining trade.

                     New goods and services enabled by technology will impact trade flows
                     Technology can transform some products and services, altering the content and volume
                     of trade flows in the process. For example, McKinsey’s automotive practice estimates that
                     electric vehicles will make up some 17 percent of total car sales globally by 2030, up from
                     1 percent in 2017. This could reduce trade in vehicle parts by up to 10 percent (since EVs
                     have many fewer moving parts than traditional models) while also dampening oil imports.

                     The shift from physical to digital flows that started years ago with individual movies, albums,
                     and games is now evolving once again as companies such as Netflix, Tencent Video, and
                     Spotify popularize streaming and subscription models. Streaming now accounts for nearly
                     40 percent of global recorded music revenues. In 2018, Drake became the first artist to hit
                     50 billion streams globally, and his album Scorpion was streamed a billion times around
                     the world in just one week. Cloud computing uses a similar pay-as-you-go or subscription
                     model for storage and software, freeing users from making heavy capital investments in
                     their own IT infrastructure.

                            The advent of ultra-fast 5G wireless networks opens new possibilities for delivering services.
                            Remote surgery, for example, may become more viable as networks transmit sharp images
                            without any delays and robots respond more precisely to remote manipulation. In industrial
                            plants, 5G can support augmented and virtual reality–based maintenance from remote
                            locations, creating new service and data flows.

                            skills. Automation in production reduces the value of labor-cost arbitrage and enables
                            location decisions based on proximity to customers. Companies can capture significant
                            efficiencies from new technologies in production and logistics, but they need end-to-end
                            integration across their supplier networks to realize the full potential. Digital disrupters are
                            turning up the pressure on incumbents in industry after industry, and they are expanding
                            up and down the value chain. Several imperatives stand out for global companies in
                            this landscape:

                             Reassess where to compete along the value chain. Business leaders need to
                               continuously monitor where value is moving in their industry and adapt accordingly.23
                               Some companies, like Apple and many pharmaceutical firms, have narrowed their focus
                               to R&D and distribution while outsourcing production. By contrast, many makers of
                               consumer goods take a hyperlocal approach, with customized product portfolios for
                               individual markets. Providers of “global-local” services, such as Airbnb and Uber, have
                               recognized global brands but also extensive local operations that deliver in-person
                               services. Network companies, most of which are knowledge-intensive service providers,
                               create value through a geographically dispersed operating model and global reach.
                               Regardless of the strategy, a key point is to maintain control, trust, and collaboration
                               in all parts of the value chain. For some companies, this might mean bringing more
                               operations in-house. Those that outsource need to re-evaluate supplier relationships
                               and management (see below).

                             Consider how to capture value from services. Across multiple value chains
                               (including manufacturing), more value is coming from services, whether software,
                               design, intellectual property, distribution, marketing, or after-sales services. Shifting to
                               services can offer advantages: smoothing cyclicality in sales, providing higher-margin
                               revenue streams, and enabling new sales or design ideas due to closer interaction
                               with customers. At its extreme, entire business models shift from producing goods
                               to delivering services (for example, from selling vehicles to offering transportation
                               services, or from selling packaged software and servers to selling cloud subscriptions).
                               To excel in services, companies need to gain insight into customer needs, invest in
                               data and analytics, and develop the right subscription, per-use, or performance-based
                               service contracts.

                      Reconsider your operational footprint to reflect new risks. One of the most
                        important considerations is where to locate operations and invest in new capacity. The
                        calculus that held in the past is different today. New automation technologies, changing
                        factor costs, an expanding set of risks, and the need for speed and efficiency are all
                        driving regionalization in many goods-producing value chains. As a result, it may make
                        sense to place production in or near key consumer markets around the world. Before
                        investing, companies should consider the full risk-adjusted, end-to-end landed costs
                        of location decisions—and today many do not account for all of the variables. Using a
                        dynamic, risk-adjusted scenario approach rather than a simple point forecast of demand
                        or cost can inform better decisions about shaping an operational footprint.

                      Be flexible and resilient. Today companies face a more complex set of unknowns
                        as the postwar world order that held for decades seems to be giving way. There is a
                        real chance that tariffs and nontariff barriers will continue to rise, reversing decades
                        of trade liberalization. Tax codes are being reconsidered to account for flows of data
                        and intangibles. Building agile operations can help firms prepare for these types of
                        uncertainties. This can take many forms, such as using versatile common platforms to
                        share components across product lines and multiple plants. In purchasing, companies
                        have achieved flexibility through price hedging, long-term contracting, shaping customer
                        demand to enable using substitutes, and building redundancies into supply chains.

                      Prioritize speed to market and proximity to customers. Companies in all industries
                        now have a wealth of real-time, granular sales and consumer behavior data at their
                        disposal, but it takes manufacturing and distribution excellence to capitalize on these
                        insights. Speed to market enables faster responses to what customers want and less
                        product waste from forecasting errors. This does not necessarily require large-scale
                        reshoring or full vertical integration in every major market. Companies can opt for
                        postponement—that is, creating a largely standardized product at a distance and then
                        finishing it with custom touches at a facility near the end market.

                      Build closer supplier relationships. In the last era of globalization, the fragmentation
                        of value chains and the trend toward offshoring led many companies into arm’s-length
                        relationships with suppliers across the globe. But that approach involved hidden risks
                        and costs. It makes sense to identify which suppliers are core to the business, then
                        solicit their ideas and deepen relationships with them. With a growing share of product
                        value being provided by the supply chain, firms that genuinely collaborate can secure
                        preferred customer status and benefit from new product ideas or process efficiencies
                        bubbling up from suppliers. Large firms can also bring about systemic changes along
                        the value chain, improving labor and environmental standards. Logistics and production
                        technologies can transform supply chains, but optimizing what they can do requires
                        end-to-end integration. Larger companies may need to help their small and medium-size
                        suppliers upgrade and add digital capabilities to realize the full value.

                     THE ROAD AHEAD IS DIVERGING FOR DIFFERENT SETS OF COUNTRIES
                     AND WORKERS
                     To understand the larger implications of these shifts in global value chains, we group
                     countries into nine categories (Exhibit E8). We first divide them into two groups: advanced
                     and developing. From there, we further segment them based on the global value chain
                     archetype in which they run the largest trade surplus. While countries participate in multiple
                     global value chains (as seen in the diversification metric), these groupings nevertheless offer
                     a useful way to assess their exposure to ongoing structural shifts.

                     The specific challenges and opportunities differ for each of these groups. Yet a few priorities
                     apply across the board. No matter where countries specialize today, strengthening service
                     sectors and capabilities is an important opportunity for the future. Investment in R&D
                     will be critical to competing in an increasingly knowledge-intensive global economy. All
                     countries—and particularly those that are major producers of labor-intensive goods—
                     need to prepare for the wider adoption of automation technologies. There is a great deal
                     of unrealized potential in deepening regional trade ties in many parts of the world. Finally,
                     every country can benefit from streamlining customs operations and modernizing trade
                     agreements for a global economy in which flows of services, intellectual property, and data
                     are increasingly vital.

                     Shifts in global value chains may favor some advanced economies
                     There is reason to believe many advanced economies may have already made it through
                     the worst of the disruption stemming from the globalization of value chains. The structural
                     shifts described in this research favor countries with skilled workforces, service capabilities,
                     innovation ecosystems, and lucrative consumer markets—all of which line up with the
                     comparative advantages of advanced economies. These countries will also benefit from the
                     rise of consumers in developing countries if they can tap into export demand. These trends
                     could be good news, especially for highly skilled workers and those in service industries.

                     Across advanced economies, however, outlooks and priorities vary. Those with strong
                     service sectors and exports, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and
                     Sweden, should be able to capitalize on their existing strengths as trade grows in industries
                     such as IT services, business services, healthcare, and education. In contrast, those
                     that excel mainly in global innovations value chains, such as Germany, Japan, and South
                     Korea, may find a more challenging environment ahead as China expands its capabilities
                     and surpluses in these industries. Advanced economies that excel in regional processing
                     value chains, such as Spain, Portugal, Austria, and Finland, will be more insulated from
                     competition emanating from developing countries, given the lower tradability of those value
                     chains. Indeed, these countries may offer an interesting model for the development of
                     low-income countries. Resource producers, whether high-income or low-income, face a
                     growing imperative to diversify their economies.

                     As global demand shifts to the developing world, new opportunities are opening for
                     producers in advanced economies. The share of advanced-economy exports to developing
                     economies increased from 23 percent in 1995 to more than 40 percent in 2017, with notable
                     growth in machinery and equipment along with computers and electronics (Exhibit E9).

                     For all advanced economies, public and private R&D spending is essential to maintaining
                     an edge in exports. Trade policies need to address issues surrounding cross-border
                     digital flows (including data privacy, cybersecurity, and market access), nontariff barriers to
                     services trade, and intellectual property protections.

                                 Developing countries with geographic proximity to large consumer markets or
                                 with tradable service expertise also stand to gain
                                 In some middle-income countries, manufacturing workers may face disruptions in the years
                                 ahead as some production shifts to lower-wage countries and as automation technologies
                                 substitute for some types of labor. Higher levels of productivity and skills will be important
                                 for middle-income countries to set themselves apart; this includes keeping pace with
                                 technology advances in both manufacturing and logistics. China, for example, is steadily
                                 climbing into the higher-value global innovators group by embracing automation and AI.
                                 Developing specialized capabilities can help middle-income countries carve out new roles
                                 in specific industry value chains and attract more foreign direct investment. But low-skill
                                 workers in those countries may struggle to find a place in the new economy.

                            Historically, labor-intensive manufacturing for export has been the only successful path for
                            low- and middle-income countries to rapidly climb the economic ladder. Now the window
                            of opportunity may be narrowing as automation technologies erode the advantage of large
                            low-wage workforces.24 But the window is not closed yet. Developing economies such as
                            Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam are managing to achieve solid growth in labor-intensive
                            manufacturing exports, while China continues to develop more knowledge-intensive
                            sectors. Countries pursuing this path will need to invest in transportation and logistics
                            infrastructure and modern, technology-enabled factories that can compete globally.
                            Regional processing value chains may be a promising avenue for diversification.

                            One subset of developing countries has a critical advantage: geographic proximity to major
                            advanced economy consumer markets. As automation changes the balance of capital
                            and labor, many multinationals are considering investing in new production capabilities
                            closer to end consumer markets to tighten coordination of their supply chains and reduce
                            shipping times. Mexico plays this type of “nearshoring” role for the United States; Turkey
                            and a number of Eastern European countries are linked into value chains based in Western
                            Europe; and Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia play the same role for higher-income Asia–
                            Pacific countries. This trend may also lead China to rely more on neighboring countries
                            for production.

                            Another set of developing countries that specialize in traded BPO and IT services, including
                            the Philippines, Morocco, Costa Rica, and India, will have opportunities as services trade
                            rises. But they will also be challenged, because the ongoing adoption of AI and virtual
                            agents may reduce the market for offshore back-office services. These countries could
                            move into higher-value offerings such as software and web development, graphic design,
                            and data analysis.

                            Many countries in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia have limited participation in global
                            value chains, and they are also less connected to the rest of the world in flows of finance,
                            people, and data. Their challenge is to find new openings and to create the necessary
                            business environment, infrastructure, policy foundations, and human capital.

                            Recent MGI research has also emphasized the role of competition and productive large
                            firms in creating a virtuous cycle of growth.25 One pathway for the least connected countries
                            may be regional integration. Existing trading blocs in Latin America and Africa could be
                            deepened to create regional trade opportunities, particularly in industries such as food
                            and beverage and regional processing. The digitization of the global economy sets higher
                            hurdles for developing economies, but mobile apps, cloud computing, and digital finance
                            also hold possibilities for leapfrog growth.

                                                                                     •••

                            Global value chains are changing in fundamental ways as demand soars in the developing
                            world, China and other developing economies build more comprehensive supply chains,
                            and next-generation technologies come online. These shifts have implications for where and
                            how companies compete. This period of transition is an opening for countries and regions to
                            carve out new specializations and new roles in value chains, but policy makers will need to
                            address the dislocations globalization can cause even as they prepare for the opportunities
                            of the future.

24             McKinsey Global Institute   Executive summary


1. MOVING PARTS: THE EVOLUTION OF
GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS
Following the Industrial Revolution, the falling cost of shipping set off an “unbundling”
that enabled trade from halfway around the globe.26 The 1990s and 2000s saw another
revolution—this time in information and communications technology (ICT)—that brought
about huge transformations in how and where things are made. Companies that once
handled all stages of production began to disaggregate them, breaking them into discrete
steps and outsourcing some. With falling costs of communication and new types of
software and digital platforms, companies could source from a much wider universe of
suppliers, coordinate complex processes, and track shipments anywhere in the world in real
time. The internet enabled the realignment of global production, with firms and countries
specializing in specific parts of different industry value chains. Our 2016 research report
documented the soaring volume and value of cross-border data flows, which have become
the connective tissue holding the global economy together.27

Today two-thirds of world trade is in intermediate inputs rather than finished goods and
services.28 This underscores the extent to which both manufacturing and service industries
are now organized into sprawling global value chains that span countries and regions. Yet
production networks are not static, and they are continuing to evolve today. Their broad
contours determine where things are produced, how they are created, and how they make
their way to consumers. Their dynamics are essential to understanding how globalization is
evolving and where it may be headed in the future.

In this report, we analyze global value chains within 23 industries across 43 countries (see
Box 1, “Methodology, data sources, and new contributions of this report”). Collectively,
they represent 96 percent of global trade and roughly 70 percent of both gross output and
employment. Examining their dynamics during the period from 1995 through 2017, we see
that that the mid-2000s were a turning point.

Global value chains and trade patterns have been changing in fundamental ways. The global
financial crisis and the Great Recession did not cause these shifts, but they did obscure
them for a time. The pre-recession years, marked by lengthening value chains and soaring
growth in trade, were an anomaly as China integrated into the world economy and the ICT
revolution made it possible to coordinate far-flung suppliers. Today the world is settling into
a new version of normal as China and other developing economies grow and mature, as
global demand shifts, and as new technologies reshape production and trade.

The 23 global value chains we study range from sophisticated manufacturing to primary
industries to complex services. We classify them into six archetypes to highlight their
differing dynamics and diverging paths. Overall, we identify five structural shifts occurring
across these value chains. Together they signal that globalization is entering a new chapter
as companies and countries alike refine the roles they play within it. Regardless of how
changes in trade policy ultimately play out, globalization is still going strong—but it is
changing form.

                                  WHAT IS A GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN?
                                  Simply put, a global value chain includes all the activities and inputs used to create a
                                  final good or service. Each one is the product of millions of decisions made by individual
                                  businesses about which global growth opportunities to pursue, how to organize operations,
                                  which production steps they will conduct themselves, and the extent to which they will rely
                                  on suppliers. These decisions shape the movement and volume of global flows of goods,
                                  services, finance, data, and even people.

                                  Bananas are an example of a traditionally traded good that does not involve a value chain. A
                                  farmer in Brazil, for example, cultivates bananas, which are trucked off to a packaging plant
                                  in a coastal port, then boxed up in crates and sent to the United States. The banana in this
                                  example goes from the producing country to the consuming country directly, without any
                                  other countries performing intermediate steps along the way.

                                  Yet even in primary industries such as agriculture and mining, a certain degree of trade flows
                                  through value chains. The farmer may use imported fertilizers and pesticides. Tractors,
                                  trucks, and other equipment may also come from other countries. Food and beverage;
                                  glass, cement, and ceramics; and basic metals all have relatively simple sequential value
                                  chains. Apparel, furniture, and fabricated metals have somewhat more complex sequences,
                                  with more traded inputs and intermediate steps before the final good is produced
                                  and consumed.




26               McKinsey Global Institute        1. Moving parts: The evolution of global value chains


                            The majority of global trade is actually in intermediate rather than finished goods. The highly
                            complex value chains in industries producing automobiles, computers, and other machinery
                            and transportation equipment involve hundreds of inputs and span dozens of countries. The
                            iPhone, for instance, starts with teams of designers and engineers in California. Although it
                            fits into the palm of your hand, it contains parts from as many as 200 separate suppliers in
                            at least eight countries.29 All the various parts are manufactured separately, then shipped to
                            a factory in China, where they are assembled into one slim smartphone. It is boxed up and
                            shipped, perhaps arriving at an Apple distributor in Rome, where an Italian consumer will
                            pull it off the shelf. This multistep, multicountry process is a global value chain in action.

                            Global value chains can also produce services. But rather than following the kind of
                            sequential process that occurs in manufacturing value chains, service value chains
                            resemble networks.30 A provider of corporate IT services in Bangalore, for example, may use
                            hardware produced in China and software developed in Germany, while working with a local
                            affiliate in Switzerland that communicates directly with clients. Similarly, the value provided
                            by a logistics company such as DHL comes from the many nodes (both company-run and
                            subcontracted) it can mobilize to serve any country of origin and destination. A package
                            from Croatia destined for Russia may pass through nodes in Germany and Poland, each
                            adding value along the way.

                            GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS FIT INTO SIX ARCHETYPES THAT EXPLAIN COUNTRY
                            PARTICIPATION AND TRADE PATTERNS
                            We classify industry value chains into six major archetypes to highlight their reliance on
                            different inputs, their trade patterns, and country participation (Exhibit 1). These groupings
                            explain differences in trade intensity, for example, and therefore the potential for either a
                            broad or narrow set of countries to participate. We base much of the analyses throughout
                            the report on these archetypes.

                            First, we look at the inputs of each value chain, including its labor intensity (defined as share
                            of labor compensation in gross value added), its knowledge intensity (defined as share of
                            workers with bachelor’s degrees or higher), and its commodity intensity (defined as share
                            of commodity inputs in gross output). These input factor intensities influence where firms
                            decide to locate production. The second set of metrics relates to trade and how countries
                            participate in it. We consider each value chain’s global trade intensity (the ratio of gross
                            exports to gross output), the share of trade within each value chain that is intraregional,
                            the share of trade accounted for by developing countries, and the number of countries
                            accounting for 75 percent of each value chain’s exports. To offer perspective on each value
                            chain’s weight in global production and trade, we also provide their gross output, value
                            added, value added per employee, and gross exports in absolute terms.

                                 and “spiders” (networks). All authors agree that global value chains can take different forms depending on the
                                 stages of production. Indeed, an automotive value chain is a “spider” before assembly but a “snake” through
                                 the manufacturing of the body. Miroudot distinguishes between “facilitated user networks” and “value shops”
                                 among service global value chains. Networks create value through their dispersed structure (as in insurance),
                                 whereas value shops create value by packaging and customizing a set of inputs for a single customer (as in IT
                                 services).

                                   Global innovations. These are the most valuable, knowledge-intensive, and trade-
                                     intensive value chains (Exhibit 2). They include computers and electronics, automobiles,
                                     other machinery and transportation equipment, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
                                     The final products tend to be highly modular, bringing together components from
                                     multiple countries. They involve many sequential steps and intricate components that
                                     may require subassembly; in fact, 51 percent of trade within these value chains is in
                                     intermediate goods rather than finished products. In automotive, for example, hundreds
                                     of suppliers provide inputs: basic commodities like aluminum, leather-covered door
                                     paneling, transmissions, processors and software, and many more.

                                        Relative to other archetypes, global innovations value chains employ a small workforce
                                        to make high-value products. They employ only 4 percent of the world’s workforce
                                        (131 million people), which collectively produces 13 percent of global output and
                                        35 percent of global exports. These are the most knowledge-intensive of all goods-
                                        producing value chains: one-third of the workers have bachelor’s degrees or above.
                                        Competition in these industries is based on innovation and product quality, so R&D
                                        is a crucial step that generates the lion’s share of the value. This group’s spending on
                                        intangible assets such as R&D, innovation, and IP averages 30 percent of revenues,

                                compared to 10 percent on average for all other goods-producing value chains. These
                                value chains are also geographically concentrated, with fewer countries participating.
                                Just eight countries drive more than 75 percent of trade in computers and electronics.
                                Advanced economies account for two-thirds of trade in global innovations value chains,
                                and China is the largest single exporter in the group, representing 14 percent of trade (up
                                from 2 percent in 1995).

                             Labor-intensive goods. These value chains include textiles and apparel, toys,
                               shoes, and furniture. Their defining feature is their heavy reliance on low-skill labor.
                               Labor compensation accounts for over two-thirds of value added in the sector. The
                               value added per worker is low ($24,000 on average, compared to $46,000 in global
                               innovations). Much of this production shifted to the developing world in the last wave of
                               globalization; today those nations represent 62 percent of global trade in these value
                               chains, a higher share than in any other archetype. Given their light weight, the products
                               in these value chains are highly tradable; 28 percent of global output is exported.

                                Although labor-intensive manufacturing value chains are synonymous in many people’s
                                minds with globalization, they make up only 7 percent of the world’s trade, 3 percent of
                                gross output, and 3 percent of the global workforce (100 million people). Even in China,
                                which accounts for one-third of the trade in these value chains, labor-intensive goods
                                make up only 5 percent of the nation’s own gross output, value added, and employment.
                                As we discuss in Chapter 4, new automation technologies are poised to reshape which
                                countries participate in these value chains.

                             Regional processing. These simple sequential value chains process commodities into
                               basic goods, such as paper, steel, fabricated metal, food and beverage, and rubber
                               goods. Their defining feature is relatively low tradability due to the weight, bulk, or
                               perishability of the goods, or to varying regional tastes. However, trade is growing faster
                               in these value chains than in the global innovations or labor-intensive goods archetypes.

                                These value chains use relatively few intermediate inputs. With the exception of food
                                and beverage, more than two-thirds of the output they produce becomes intermediate
                                input that feeds into other value chains, particularly global innovations. For instance,
                                82 percent of output in fabricated metal products value chains and 74 percent of output
                                in paper and printing are intermediate goods. Yet only 16 percent of gross output is
                                traded, the lowest share of any of our goods value chain archetypes. Because of this,
                                production is distributed around the world. The top five countries by exports make up
                                only 39 percent of this group’s total exports, while the top five in global innovations and
                                labor-intensive goods account for more than half of total exports. Developing countries
                                participate moderately in these value chains, representing 43 percent of exports, and
                                China is the largest exporter. Trade tends to occur among neighboring countries;
                                intraregional trade makes up 56 percent of total trade, compared to less than 50 percent
                                in other groups of value chains. Globally, regional processing value chains employ
                                5 percent of the global workforce (169 million people), far more than labor-intensive
                                goods or global innovations.

                             Resource-intensive goods. This archetype includes agriculture, mining, energy,
                               and basic metals. Its gross output stands at around $20 trillion, approaching that of
                               global innovations value chains. Much of that output feeds into other value chains as
                               intermediate input. Access to natural resources as well as proximity to storage and
                               transportation infrastructure determines where production is located. Countries around
                               the world participate, with 19 countries generating 75 percent of resource-intensive
                               goods exports. The top five countries account for a lower share of exports in this group
                               than in any other, at just 29 percent. While agriculture employs almost 870 million
                               people globally, the other industries in this category employ only 49 million people in

                         total, or 1.5 percent of the global workforce. Resource-intensive value chains contribute
                         11 percent of global value added, the highest share among all goods-producing
                         archetypes. Mining and energy have the highest value added per employee among all
                         goods-producing value chains we studied.

                      Labor-intensive services. These large and labor-intensive value chains include retail
                        and wholesale, transportation and storage, and healthcare. Given the in-person nature
                        of these services, trade intensity is low, but trade is growing faster in these value chains
                        than in any other archetype. Transportation, for example, has increased with the rise of
                        goods trade and tourism and business travel; rising trade in wholesale and retail reflects
                        the global expansion of retailers such as Carrefour and Walmart. These value chains are
                        the largest job creators after agriculture, employing more than 740 million people globally
                        (23 percent), two-thirds of whom are in wholesale and retail trade. This is seven times
                        higher than employment in labor-intensive manufacturing value chains. Labor-intensive
                        services generate the highest gross output ($28 trillion) of all groups of value chains, and
                        half is generated by wholesale and retail trade. While often overlooked by policy makers,
                        these sectors are an important part of the economy in all countries. Their value added
                        per employee is the same as in labor-intensive manufacturing (roughly $25,000).

                      Knowledge-intensive services. These value chains include professional services,
                        financial intermediation, and IT services. They depend on skilled labor and derive
                        substantial value from intangible assets. More than half of the people they employ have
                        a bachelor’s degree or above. Although they would seem to be inherently unconstrained
                        by geography, these value chains have lower trade intensity than goods-producing
                        industries, largely due to regulatory barriers. Because costs are not directly related
                        to distance, the trade flows that do occur span the globe. Many of the participating
                        companies are headquartered in advanced economies; just 21 percent of all exports
                        come from developing economies, the lowest share among all value chain archetypes.
                        The United States is the leading exporter of knowledge-intensive services (and services
                        exports in general), representing 17 percent of trade in this group. The top five exporting
                        countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, and France)
                        together represent 46 percent of global exports. Relatively high concentration reflects
                        the significant investment in intangibles required to participate in these value chains.

                     GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS ARE UNDERGOING FIVE STRUCTURAL SHIFTS
                     The 1990s and early 2000s saw industry value chains expand around the globe. Over the
                     most recent decade, they have evolved yet again. Today it is becoming clear that global
                     trade flows will not necessarily return to their earlier levels or patterns. Indeed, the 1990s and
                     early 2000s were an exceptional growth period marked by China’s integration into the global
                     economy and the ICT revolution. Our analysis documents five structural changes in global
                     value chains. In subsequent chapters, we explore the reasons for these changes—and
                     conclude they are likely to continue into the future.

                     1. Goods-producing value chains have grown less trade-intensive
                     Nearly all global value chains expanded rapidly from 1995 to 2007. On average, global trade
                     in intermediate inputs rose from 6.8 percent of gross output in 1995 to 10.0 percent in 2007,
                     increasing threefold, from $2.5 trillion to $7.5 trillion. This growth was fueled in particular by
                     makers of computers and electronics, vehicles, chemicals, and machinery. These changes
                     reflected the unbundling of production, which allowed for offshoring and outsourcing to
                     improve efficiency.

                     But since the Great Recession, the world has entered a new phase. We find that this was not
                     simply a secular trend, but a reflection of deeper structural shifts. Sixteen of the 17 goods-
                     producing global value chains we examined contracted between 2007 and 2017 (Exhibit 3).

                                    Trade has continued to grow in absolute terms. But over the past decade, exports declined
                                    from 28.1 to 22.5 percent of gross output in goods-producing value chains.


Exhibit 3

After increasing prior to 2007, trade intensity has since declined in almost all goods-producing global value chains.

McKinsey Global Institute           Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains                                                       33


                     While part of the decline in trade intensity is due to price effects, growth in the volume of
                     global goods trade has also slowed since 2007. Between 1990 and 2007, global trade
                     volumes grew 2.1 times faster than real GDP on average. Between 2011 and 2017, they grew
                     only 1.1 times faster on average.31

                     The largest declines in trade intensity were in the most heavily traded and complex global
                     value chains (the groups we refer to as global innovations and labor-intensive goods). The
                     trend is apparent in industries that include computers and electronics, electrical machinery,
                     automotive, chemicals, transportation equipment, and textiles and apparel. But it has not
                     occurred in service value chains, as we will discuss below.

                     Much of the reduction in trade intensity is due to shifts within China and, to a lesser extent,
                     in other developing countries. As the consuming class expands and gains new spending
                     power, these countries are selling more of what they produce domestically rather than
                     exporting it.32 China and other developing countries are driving the world’s output growth,
                     and companies based there see soaring consumer demand within their own borders as
                     the biggest and most easily captured opportunity. Trade intensity is also falling as these
                     countries develop domestic supply chains and vertically integrated industries, reducing their
                     need to import intermediate goods. In computers and electronics, for example, China has
                     begun producing a wider range of components and is moving into higher-value parts of the
                     value chain as it builds a semiconductor industry.

                     The trend toward decreasing trade intensity does not signal that globalization is over. It
                     is a sign of the gradual and ongoing convergence between developing and advanced
                     economies in terms of both consumption and production capabilities, and especially the
                     changes within China’s economy. More production is happening in proximity to major
                     consumer markets. We discuss these shifts in detail in Chapter 3.

                     2. Services play a growing and undervalued role in trade
                     While global goods trade has fallen relative to GDP, trade in services is moving in the
                     opposite direction. Over the last 10 years, trade in services has grown more than 60 percent
                     faster than global goods trade (Exhibit 4). In some industries—including IT services,
                     business services, and IP charges—growth is two to three times faster.

                     Traditional trade statistics do not capture the full scope of services in global trade.
                     First, services provide a large and growing share of the value of traded goods. Second,
                     intracompany transfers of intangibles such as brands, intellectual property, software,
                     and operational processes tend to be underreported in trade statistics. Third, free digital
                     services offered globally create substantial value for consumers. Finally, the line between
                     goods and services is blurring as they are increasingly bundled together. We focus more
                     fully on services in Chapter 2.

                     Services create 31 percent of the value that goes into traded manufactured goods.33 R&D,
                     engineering, sales and marketing, finance, and human resources all enable goods to go to
                     market. Moreover, there has been a shift toward more of those service inputs coming from
                     international providers. In all goods-producing global value chains, traded service inputs
                     are growing substantially while domestic service inputs are declining somewhat. Although

                     31
                          Trade volumes are measured by trade in real prices. See World Trade Statistical Review 2018, World Trade

                               directly measured service flows are only 23 percent of total trade flows, they now account
                               for 45 percent of the value added in trade flows.

times faster.

                               Yet even looking at value added reveals only a partial picture. The intangible assets that
                               multinational companies send to their affiliates around the world, as well as soaring cross-
                               border flows of free digital goods (such as email, search, and music and video services),
                               often go untracked in trade statistics.34 Our work to value these undercounted aspects
                               suggests that if they were counted, services would account for more than half of the value
                               added in all trade—exceeding the value of trade in goods. This view would also substantially
                               shift the trade balance for some countries, particularly the United States.

                               The distinction between goods and services is also becoming more blurred as
                               manufacturers and retailers increasingly introduce “as a service” models. McKinsey projects
                               that automotive manufacturers, for example, may derive up to 30 percent of their revenues
                               from service offerings by 2030 as they shift from one-time car purchases to providing a
                               more comprehensive range of mobility services (such as car sharing, ride hailing, transit
                               services, bike sharing, and parking).

                               3. Trade based on labor-cost arbitrage is declining in many goods-producing
                               value chains
                               A common perception is that trade flows are driven by multinational corporations searching
                               for the lowest possible labor costs. But our analysis finds that trade based on labor-cost
                               arbitrage represents only 18 percent of overall goods trade today. We define this as exports
                               from low-wage countries to high-wage ones, where the differential in wages is five times or

                               34
                                    While some studies suggest that services trade could be overrepresented due to profit shifting that is reflected
                                    as IP charges, our estimate of intracompany flows of intangibles crossing borders suggests that their
                                    value exceeds officially reported IP charges for most large suppliers of intangibles (for instance, the United
                                    States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland). Given that IP charges also include flows between
                                    companies, cross-border flows of intangibles are likely to be underrepresented in official statistics.

                                    higher.35 In other words, the vast majority of trade flows today are based on specialization,
                                    resource scarcity, proximity to markets, access to talent, and other factors—not only
                                    wage costs.36

                                    Moreover, over the last decade, the share of trade based on labor-cost arbitrage has
                                    declined in many value chains. From 1995 to 2005, exports from low-wage countries to
                                    high-wage countries grew in nearly all value chains as industries fragmented and production
                                    moved to China and other developing countries. But this share has more recently been
                                    declining in many value chains. In labor-intensive goods, such as textiles and apparel,
                                    exports from low-wage to high-wage countries fell from 55 percent of all exports in 2007
                                    to 43 percent in 2017 (Exhibit 5). While trade in these value chains has been growing, the
                                    portion based on labor-cost arbitrage has declined; some of this is due to the convergence
                                    of incomes across countries and the shift toward South-South trade. But the trend is not
                                    universal: in contrast, the automotive sector’s share of trade based on labor-cost arbitrage
                                    almost doubled from 6 percent in 2007 to 11 percent in 2017.

                                    This pattern is also uneven across geographies. The United States increased its share
                                    of imports from low-wage countries from 47 to 53 percent between 2007 and 2017;
                                    this was driven mainly by China’s growing share of US goods imports, which rose from
                                    17 to 22 percent during that period. The share of imports from low-wage countries fell
                                    in advanced Asian economies and in the EU (by eight and three percentage points,
                                    respectively). This trend reflects the fact that wages and GDP per capita in developing
                                    economies are slowly catching up with those in advanced economies over time.

                                         If we vary the ratio of GDP per capita of the exporter and importer from 2 to 10, we find that labor-cost
                                         arbitrage ranges from 5 to 30 percent of overall global trade. At any level within this broader range, we
                                         continue to see a decline in labor-cost arbitrage in value chains producing labor-intensive goods.

                                         This analysis excludes trade in commodities, as those flows are defined by access to commodities rather than

                                                              4. Global value chains are growing more knowledge-intensive
                                                              A corollary to the decline of labor-cost arbitrage is that global value chains are growing more
                                                              knowledge-intensive. Within many industries, value creation is shifting to upstream activities
                                                              such as R&D and design and to downstream activities such as distribution, marketing,
                                                              and after-sales services. The share of value created by the actual production of a good is
                                                              declining.37 This explains the rise of “virtual manufacturing” companies such as Apple and
                                                              Nike that use contract manufacturers to produce their products but maintain the upstream
                                                              and downstream functions themselves. In some industries, R&D, software, design, and
                                                              other intangibles are adding more value to goods than production.

                                                              Overall, investment in intangible assets now outpaces investment in physical plants and
                                                              equipment. In all value chains, capitalized spending on R&D and intangible assets such
                                                              as brands, software, and IP is growing as a share of revenue, rising from 5.4 percent of
                                                              revenue in 2000 to 13.1 percent in 2016 (Exhibit 6).38 The increase was highest in value
                                                              chains producing global innovations. Companies in the machinery and equipment value
                                                              chain, for example, spend 36 percent of revenues on R&D and intangibles, while those in
                                                              pharmaceuticals and medical devices average 80 percent.

                     We also see growing knowledge intensity in value chains as products themselves now
                     involve more sophisticated, proprietary inputs. In autos, for example, software accounts
                     for 10 percent of the value of a car, and McKinsey expects that share to rise to 30 percent
                     by 2030.39 In apparel, low-priced goods in natural fibers and polyester still dominate world
                     output, but new synthetic fabrics are gaining ground. In athletic clothing, microfibers that
                     wick sweat away from the body and dry quickly are replacing basic cotton shorts and
                     T-shirts. The quality of synthetic suedes and leathers is improving, and they are being used
                     in more innovative ways. Complex hand finishes can raise the price of even a once-basic
                     item such as a pair of jeans to over $200.

                     As value chains become more knowledge-intensive, they also employ a larger share of
                     highly skilled labor. We find that the share of income going to high-skill labor has increased
                     in all value chains.40 In US manufacturing, the share of compensation going to high-skill
                     workers increased 5.5 percentage points between 1995 and 2009, while the share going to
                     medium-skill workers fell 6.1 points and to low-skill workers 2.5 points.41 This is not only a US
                     phenomenon: we see similar patterns in Chinese manufacturing.42

                     5. Value chains are starting to become more regionally concentrated
                     Long-haul trade that spanned the globe became more prevalent after China entered the
                     WTO in 2001 and other developing countries assumed a more prominent role in global value
                     chains. The share of trade in goods that occurred within a given region, rather than between
                     more far-flung regions, declined from 51 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2012. Now that
                     trend is reversing. The intraregional share of world trade has increased by 2.7 percentage
                     points since 2013 (Exhibit 7). The biggest drivers of the trend toward regionalization are
                     increasing trade flows within the EU-28 and within the Asia–Pacific region, particularly trade
                     centered on China.

                     Global innovations value chains have experienced the most pronounced shift toward
                     regionalization, given their need for just-in-time sequencing. Intricate value chains in
                     industries such as automotive and electronics span multiple countries within the Asia–
                     Pacific region. Outside of China (which has a largely self-contained auto market with parts
                     sourced locally), automotive value chains operate mostly in regional blocs centered on
                     Germany, the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Supply chains extend into smaller
                     neighboring economies with lower labor costs. This trend could accelerate in other value
                     chains as well, as automation reduces the importance of labor costs and increases the
                     importance of speed to market in company decisions about where to produce goods.

                     Intraregional trade has also been on the rise since 2007 in other parts of the developing
                     world, including the Middle East and North Africa (up 5.6 percentage points) and Sub-
                     Saharan Africa (up 1.0 point). This is good news for these countries, which historically
                     have had very low shares of intraregional trade and small economies that lack scale. In
                     a framework announced in 2018, the Africa Continental Free Trade Area merges several
                     existing customs unions. Although many negotiations still remain and not all African
                     countries have yet joined, it has the potential to create a continent-wide single market that
                     could unleash more intraregional trade in the future.

                                    New technologies, increasing consumption in the developing world, and shifts in China’s
                                    economy (not to mention tariffs) all set the stage for goods-producing value chains to
                                    continue to make their production footprints more regional and less long-haul. Indeed,
                                    McKinsey estimates that nearshoring of apparel production (that is, production in places
                                    like Turkey for the European market and Mexico for the US market) can already be profitable
                                    today and is likely to become more so in the decade ahead.43

2. A NEW LENS FOR VALUING TRADE
IN SERVICES
More often than not, when policy makers and pundits argue over trade agreements
and tariffs, they are talking only about the flow of goods—and where the associated
manufacturing jobs will be supported. Services trade, if mentioned at all, is typically an
afterthought. While gross trade in services totaled $5.1 trillion in 2017, it was dwarfed by the
$17.3 trillion global goods trade.44

The relatively small weight of services in global trade stands in contrast to the outsize role
they play in the rest of the economy. Globally, services account for almost two-thirds of GDP
and half of all jobs. In advanced economies like the United States, services can account
for around 80 percent of GDP and private-sector employment. But many types of services
inherently do not lend themselves to trade. The people who cut your hair, repair your car,
take your dinner order, and tend your garden have to do so in person. Even those services
that are more tradable have historically been subject to many barriers. Varying national
regulations and certification standards can limit competition from foreign services providers.
Doctors and lawyers who are licensed in their home country, for example, often find that
their credentials do not allow them to practice in another.45 Accounting standards and
engineering requirements in buildings also vary by country.

Despite these limitations, global services trade overall has continued to grow faster
than global GDP. It has posted brisk annual growth of 3.9 percent annually over the
past decade—outpacing growth in global goods trade by more than 60 percent. Some
subsectors, including telecom and IT services, business services, and intellectual property
charges, are now growing two to three times faster than goods trade (Exhibit 8). As
discussed in Chapter 1, service value chains continue to increase in trade and expand
globally even as goods-producing value chains contract. Moreover, services trade spans
the entire globe and is less regionally concentrated than goods trade.

Despite its growing importance, the full scope of services in global trade is obscured in
traditional trade statistics. In this chapter, we examine just how much value they generate
that goes uncounted in metrics that directly measure services trade. We consider
three channels: the increasing share of value that services add to exported goods, the
intracompany exchange of intangibles across borders, and free digital services made
available to global users.

Our analysis suggests that these three channels collectively produce up to $8.3 trillion in
value annually—a figure that would increase overall trade flows by $4.0 trillion and reallocate
another $4.3 trillion currently counted as part of the flow of goods. Viewed through this
alternative lens, trade in services would already exceed trade in goods in value-added
terms. Moreover, the continuing march of new technologies will likely make this shift more
pronounced over time (see Chapter 4 for more on this topic). The momentum in services
underscores the fact that globalization is still moving forward in other forms, even as growth
slows in goods trade. Furthermore, the growing weight of services indicates that these
are sectors that need more attention from governments in trade agreements and national
policy agendas.

                                        FOR 45 PERCENT OF VALUE ADDED IN TRADE FLOWS
                                        Trade statistics count services that are delivered internationally, but they do not separate out
                                        the services that go into the production of traded goods.46 In many cases, those services—
                                        which include elements such as design, marketing, R&D, and other types of intellectual
                                        property—are what sets a manufactured good apart and makes it a desirable product.

                                        Consider an oncology drug. In trade statistics, any type of exported medication is booked
                                        as a manufactured good.47 But to the cancer patients who take it to extend their lives, the
                                        greatest value does not come from the manufacturing process that turns out physical pills
                                        (although the safety and accuracy of that process is vital). It stems from the years of R&D by
                                        highly credentialed scientists that went into the drug’s discovery and development as well as
                                        rounds of clinical trials that went into proving its efficacy and determining the safe dosage.

                                        Services also shape more everyday products. The production of a car begins with
                                        substantial investment in R&D to engineer fuel-efficient, safe vehicles that deliver a good
                                        driving experience, style, and comfort. This process determines the exact specifications
                                        that will define the manufacturing process, down to the last component. After the car rolls
                                        off the assembly line, services come into play again as each model is marketed, shipped to
                                        dealers, and sold. Services also make smartphones distinctive. For a smartphone running




                                        46
                                             Similarly, trade statistics do not count the value of goods used in services (e.g., paper and equipment used at
                                             an accounting firm providing services across borders).
                                        47
                                             This assumes that the drug is manufactured and then exported. In some instances, pharmaceutical
                                             companies license drugs to be both manufactured and delivered abroad; when that is the case, the
                                             transactions are counted as traded services.

                                                         This concept enables a different view of the importance of services by taking into account
                                                         not only their direct trade but also the extent to which they are embodied in exported
                                                         goods (or trade in value added).49 Within goods-producing global value chains we
                                                         examined, services represent 31 percent of the value of traded goods today—a share
                                                         that has gone up by 2.3 percentage points since 1995 (Exhibit 9). The share has risen
                                                         even more clearly, by around five percentage points, in the most complex value chains
                                                         we refer to as global innovations (including automotive, computers and electronics, and
                                                         transportation equipment).

                                 Moreover, foreign services inputs have been assuming greater weight over time. In some
                                 countries, including Ireland, Hungary, and Estonia, the foreign share of services value added
                                 is greater than the domestic share.50 For instance, global pharmaceutical companies are
                                 increasingly turning to contract development and manufacturing organizations such as
                                 Wuxi AppTec in China and Intas in India to handle their clinical trials and manufacture drugs.
                                 The growth in business process outsourcing also contributed to this trend, as companies
                                 in the West have turned to support services and call centers in hubs such as the Philippines
                                 and India.

                                 In conventional statistics that measure gross trade flows, direct trade in services accounts
                                 for only 23 percent of the value of all global trade, a figure that has changed little since 1990.
                                 But in an expanded view that also includes services that feed into the creation of goods,
                                 services account for 45 percent of the value added in global trade (Exhibit 10).51


Exhibit 10

Although services directly make up only 23 percent of global trade, they contribute 45 percent of the total
value added.

                            WORLD, A PHENOMENON THAT IS OFTEN INVISIBLE IN TRADE STATISTICS
                            Since the early 1970s, corporate investment in physical assets like equipment and
                            structures has gradually declined as a share of GDP in favor of greater investment in so-
                            called intangibles such as design, brands, and software.52 Previous MGI research has
                            found that the most profitable firms, regardless of their sector, build intellectual property and
                            secure competitive advantages by investing in R&D, brands, and other intangible assets.53
                            National accounts adjusted the treatment of intangibles in 2008 as they began to count R&D
                            and software expenditures as investments.54

                            Many of the defining aspects that consumers value in goods reflect investment in
                            intangibles. Nike shoes will keep an athlete comfortable when she runs, but her purchase
                            was influenced by a combination of design, brand, and marketing.55 Apple offers sleek
                            design and a novel in-store retail experience—not to mention brand cachet that has been
                            enhanced by decades of renowned advertising. Globally, the value of these brands,
                            including the marketing, design, and R&D that goes into their products, extends into
                            the trillions.56

                            Creating the signature look and feel of a product is often the result of large up-front R&D
                            expenditures that are treated as expenses rather than investments in reporting. But viewing
                            a core set of intangibles (including design, brand, organizational capital, and training)
                            as capitalized investments rather than current expenses shows that European and US
                            companies are now spending more on intangible assets than on tangible assets (Exhibit 11).
                            The share of income from intangibles accounts for around one-third of production value—
                            twice as high as the income generated from tangible capital.57

                                 Expenditures on R&D and software were previously considered intermediate goods and hence did not
                                 contribute to GDP. Starting in 2008, the UN Statistical Commission revised the System of National Accounts
                                 to classify these expenditures as investment and therefore part of GDP. The adoption of this revision raised the
                                 GDP of the United States and Europe by several percent.

                                    Invisible trade: The problem with intangibles
                                    Intangibles are an enormous force in the global economy, but they create measurement
                                    problems for company, trade, and GDP reporting. To understand the challenges, we focus
                                    on the distinguishing characteristics of intangibles: their sunk costs, scalability, spillovers,
                                    and synergies.58 These qualities make intangibles inherently difficult to measure.

                                    To be recognized in official accounts, a trade transaction must have a non-zero actual
                                    or implied price and a transfer of “economic ownership.”59 Multinationals are required to
                                    report services rendered to foreign affiliates, but intangibles do not always cross borders
                                    as discrete transactions. Companies spend hundreds of millions on branding, software,
                                    design, and operational systems in their headquarters or R&D hubs, and then they can use
                                    these elements in their operations around the world while the headquarters or R&D hub

                                          See Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake, Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy,
                                          Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017. Sunk costs refer to the inability to recoup the investment if
                                          an intangible does not pay off. Scalability means that companies can use their intangible asset broadly for the
                                          same cost as using it narrowly. Spillovers refers to the ease with which other firms can copy the investment,
                                          and synergies indicate the way that intangibles often evolve and mix into new and better ideas.
                                    59
                                          The balance of payments captures monetary and nonmonetary transactions. While a monetary transaction
                                          has an actual price, a nonmonetary transaction is one not initially stated in units of currency by the transacting
                                          parties (barter transactions, remuneration in kind, payments in kind, compensation in kind, and transfers
                                          in kind). The monetary values of nonmonetary transactions need to be indirectly measured or otherwise
                                          estimated. According to the IMF’s Balance of payments and international investment position manual (BPM6),
                                          transfer of economic ownership implies that that all risks, rewards, and rights and responsibilities of ownership
                                          in practice are transferred. In some cases (e.g., financial leases and transactions between an enterprise and
                                          its foreign branches), a change of “economic ownership” takes place even though “legal ownership” remains
                                          unchanged.

                            maintains ownership of them.60 There is no priced transaction since the company is not
                            reporting a change in ownership—and the scalability of an intangible like a brand, a store
                            format, or an operational system means it can be sent to multiple affiliates in other countries
                            to copy at no incremental cost. Something valuable has moved across borders, but current
                            trade statistics do not necessarily capture it.61

                            Consider how Starbucks operates in France. The company’s French stores use local labor
                            and are predisposed to source most of their offerings regionally (except perhaps the coffee
                            beans themselves). Corporate headquarters in the United States, however, has developed
                            the recipes, the brands, the marketing, and the operational system that allow local affiliates
                            like the Starbucks on the Champs-Elysées to have the look and feel of a Starbucks in Seattle
                            or anywhere else in the world. The value of these intangibles is why Starbucks can charge a
                            premium on its drinks relative to a generic coffee shop. But none of this is captured in trade
                            statistics since the brand, recipes, and processes are not leased or transferred to the affiliate
                            (although franchise agreements with licensed Starbucks shops may apply).62 Despite
                            this, there is clearly a type of trade happening, since the American traveler who spots the
                            green mermaid logo and stops in for a familiar Frappuccino is drawn in at least partially by
                            the intangibles.

                            Another example is a smartphone assembled in China with parts sourced globally. The
                            components that make up the manufactured good itself might cost only $200 (roughly
                            40 percent of the final retail price). When the phone is ultimately sold for $499, it reflects the
                            high costs of R&D, software development, and marketing that are provided in the United
                            States, as well as the value that consumers place on the design and brand.63 The difference
                            between the cost and the retail price is the gross margin, which would add to GDP in the
                            country where the good is sold. Now consider the impact on trade. Today, when that same
                            smartphone is bought in Australia, the only trade that is likely to be registered is the $200
                            wholesale cost as the physical good is shipped from China to Australia.64 Although it is the
                            primary source of value, the US contribution may never be accounted for since the software
                            is not “leased” or transferred to the contract manufacturer. Trade statistics therefore would
                            miss the $300 trade of software and R&D from the United States to China. Counting this
                            type of transaction would cast the US trade balance in a sharply different light. One study
                            estimates that in the smartphone trade alone, counting services could add $120 billion
                            annually to the US trade surplus in services.65

                                 While income from the foreign affiliate may not be captured in trade figures, it would be captured as receipts of
                                 direct investment income.

                                 According to IMF guidelines, this transaction should be captured as exports from China to the United States
                                 ($200) and exports from the United States to Australia ($499), even though the phone never physically crosses
                                 the US border. In this case, net exports of $299 would reflect US exports of intangibles. However, most
                                 statistical agencies report only the export from China to Australia ($200).

                     In some cases, when the intellectual property associated with pharmaceuticals or
                     brand trademarks is patented, intangibles are in fact recognized as trade through royalty
                     payments.66 Often these royalty flows are driven by the decisions of multinationals to place
                     intellectual property in low-cost tax havens.67 These intellectual property charges are one
                     of the fastest-growing categories of global trade. In 2017, they amounted to $366 billion
                     globally, but this is only a fraction of the flows associated with intangible assets.

                     Cross-border flows of intangible assets could be worth up to
                     $770 billion annually
                     We set out to estimate the potential value of trade in intangible goods that is missing from
                     trade statistics, considering four types of intangibles used in a variety of industries: software,
                     brands, design, and operating processes. Given the challenges in measurement, even for
                     companies themselves, we take a simplified approach to estimate the value of trade in these
                     intangibles. Using publicly available financial reporting for about 1,300 public companies,
                     we first determine the total value associated with cross-border flows of intangibles and then
                     allocate a share of this value as trade from each company’s headquarters to its local affiliates
                     (see the technical appendix for details on how we determined the value of intangibles).

                     We estimate that global trade flows of intangible assets in 2017 amounted to anywhere
                     from $330 billion to $770 billion annually.68 Our conservative estimate of the value of cross-
                     border flows of intangibles includes only costs associated with them that are attributed to
                     the country of headquarters, whereas the upper range of the estimate reflects cross-border
                     revenues to be allocated to the country of headquarters, including both costs and profit
                     above cost of capital associated with intangibles.

                     The main sectors generating cross-border flows of intangibles are technology (about
                     $230 billion annually), healthcare and pharmaceuticals (approximately $160 billion), and
                     consumer goods (about $110 billion). At the firm level, a handful of large multinationals stand
                     out as the major drivers of intangible value moving across borders. At the top of the list are
                     Samsung and Apple.

                     The United States generates almost one-third of the annual value of intangibles crossing
                     borders ($275 billion), with nearly half of this coming from the IT sector (Exhibit 12). This is
                     slightly more than US exports of intellectual property ($256 billion in 2017) and 50 percent
                     above repatriated profits of US multinational companies (which stood at $182 billion in 2017).
                     Japan (about $80 billion) and Germany (more than $70 billion) rank next in the annual value
                     of intangibles crossing borders. In both cases, exported intangibles originate mainly in the
                     consumer goods sector, driven by automotive companies. If these figures were factored
                     into trade statistics, they would significantly alter trade balances for major economies. Most

                          We do not estimate the value of the share of cross-border flows of intangibles that is already reflected in IP

                          In 2014, foreign affiliates of multinationals generated revenues of more than $18 trillion in all goods and service
                          sectors in 24 OECD countries. Part of these revenues came from foreign affiliate trade recorded in official
                          statistics (for instance, 17 percent in service sectors). See Andrea Andrenelli et al., Multinational production
                          and trade in services, OECD Trade Policy Papers, number 212, March 2018. However, only about 40 percent
                          of foreign affiliate revenues are generated by sectors in which intangibles play a major role (including IT,
                          pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, textiles and apparel, and automotive). If we adjust for the exports of
                          foreign affiliates recorded in official statistics and sectors that are not intangible-heavy, the domestic revenues
                          of foreign affiliates of intangible-heavy multinationals stand at around $6 trillion. Based on our estimates,
                          cross-border flows of intangibles attributable to the country of headquarters are from 6 to 13 percent of
                          domestic revenues of foreign affiliates in intangible-heavy sectors.

                                   notably, the adjustment would cut the US trade deficit by almost one-third, reducing it from
                                   $566 billion to $392 billion.69

                                   While services trade could be overrepresented due to profit shifting that is reflected as
                                   intellectual property charges, our estimate of intracompany flows of intangibles crossing
                                   borders exceeds officially reported IP charges for most large suppliers of intangibles (for
                                   instance, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland).70 Given that IP
                                   charges also include flows between companies, cross-border flows of intangibles are likely
                                   to be underrepresented in official statistics.

                                        Multiple factors affect the size and direction of cross-border flows of intangibles, including legal frameworks
                                        and client preferences. Another factor is the capability of foreign affiliates to absorb and adapt intangibles

                     UNTRACKED CROSS-BORDER FLOWS OF FREE DIGITAL SERVICES COULD BE
                     WORTH UP TO $3.2 TRILLION ANNUALLY
                     From e-mail and social media to mapping and search, many of the digital services we rely
                     on daily are free.71 The English-language version of Wikipedia, for example, contains some
                     5.8 million articles, and the full website encompasses 40 million articles in roughly 300
                     languages. Every day, users worldwide watch more than a billion hours of YouTube’s video
                     content. On Spotify, roughly 100 million people use the platform’s free tier, where they gain
                     access to personalized playlists and hundreds of songs to stream on demand every day.72

                     Free digital services have always posed a measurement challenge for economists—and that
                     puzzle becomes particularly vexing in the context of trade. How do we account for the fact
                     that digital services and content created in one country can attract hundreds of millions of
                     nonpaying users worldwide?

                     The most popular free digital services are the products of a relatively small group of
                     companies. Google serves about 60 percent of global search users, for example,
                     processing 1.2 trillion information requests a year. Facebook represents 24 percent of global
                     social media use. This leads to stark geographic concentration, especially given that most
                     employees of tech companies are based in the countries where they are headquartered.
                     These services have large domestic user bases, but they are also offered all over the
                     world—at near-zero cost since the trade is virtual.

                     Taken together, these facts suggest that substantial value is moving across borders in the
                     form of free digital services.73 But beyond records of cross-border advertising revenue, this
                     value is invisible in trade statistics. If it were recorded, the biggest impact in absolute terms
                     would be altering the US trade balance, since so many of the digital platforms operating in
                     this arena are based in the United States.

                     The potential value of free digital services trade ranges from $240 billion to
                     $3.2 trillion annually
                     We set out to estimate the value of free digital services moving across borders. Our first step
                     was estimating the global value of these services, then allocating a portion of that estimated
                     value to trade flows based on the headquarters country of a given website and page views
                     from outside the country. (See the technical appendix for full details on methodology.) We
                     used two approaches to measuring the value.

                     First, we considered the consumer surplus generated by the free digital service. Economist
                     and technologist Erik Brynjolfsson has estimated the implied value of free digital goods by
                     conducting surveys and asking respondents whether they would give up access to a set of
                     free services in exchange for payment to test where they would set the value. This is known
                     as “willingness to accept” (Exhibit 13). The median US participant set the value of search
                     engines at around $1,100 per month, or nearly $14,000 annually, and email at almost $600
                     per month, or around $7,000 annually.74

                     71
                          While search engines, maps, messengers, social networks, and other “free” digital services do not explicitly
                          charge users, user data could be considered an implied price of these services, as most free digital services
                          monetize the data they collect from users. See Wendy C. Y. Li, Makoto Nirei, and Kazufumi Yamana, Value of
                          data: There’s no such thing as a free lunch in the digital economy, Sixth IMF Statistical Forum, Washington,

                                  Several caveats apply when using this approach. First, the willingness-to-accept approach
                                  provides a measure of consumer surplus (that is, the difference between the price
                                  consumers pay for goods or services and the value they would have been willing to pay).
                                  Both goods and services may offer consumer surplus, but we measure it in services only.
                                  Second, setting aside the challenges of using a consumer surplus approach, contingent
                                  valuation surveys have long been criticized for inaccuracy; willingness to pay and willingness
                                  to accept frequently deviate.75 Despite these issues, we use Brynjolfsson’s estimates in an
                                  effort to provide a sense of the value of these services.

                                  Since the willingness-to-accept survey data puts the value to consumers at very high levels,
                                  we also consider what the price for a particular free service might be based on similarities
                                  to other services that do have prices. For example, we consider the implied price of video
                                  services like YouTube to be equivalent to the price of a standard Netflix subscription ($132
                                  annually). We estimate the price of messaging at $365, which is equivalent to the annualized
                                  price of five text messages per day at 20 cents each. This approach yields a much lower
                                  figure on the value of cross-border flows of free digital services ($240 billion annually).

                                  Using these two approaches, we estimate that free digital services would add anywhere
                                  from $240 billion to $3.2 trillion to trade in services. The lower estimate is based on
                                  substitute prices, while the higher estimate is based on consumer willingness-to-accept
                                  measures. This very broad range reflects uncertainty surrounding what consumers would
                                  pay for the suite of free digital services they consume, and about the business models and
                                  bundled services that might emerge if companies charged for these services. The reality
                                  is likely somewhere between these two figures. Either case, however, would represent a
                                  sizable addition to global services trade flows.

                     In the willingness-to-accept approach, the majority of the value is created by search engines
                     ($2.8 billion out of $3.2 billion) due to the outsize consumer value. More than 90 percent of
                     this value is “exported” by the United States, mainly through Google. However, using the
                     approach of the substitute prices, search engines represent only 23 percent of total value
                     of free cross-border digital services. Search engines along with social media and video
                     services constitute almost 70 percent of the estimated value of free digital services based on
                     the prices of similar goods.

                     It should be noted, however, that many “free” digital services are lucrative businesses that
                     extract value from users in other ways. In the case of YouTube and social media platforms,
                     users themselves contribute the content that makes the sites entertaining and valuable.
                     When digital services are supported by advertising, users can decide whether to make the
                     trade-off of sitting through an ad in order to use the service. But many users do not realize
                     that digital platforms are capturing, tracking, and even selling their data. These services are
                     having a broader economic impact beyond their user bases as well. The internet has created
                     an entrenched expectation that content should always be free—and that expectation has
                     made it harder for news organizations, writers, musicians, and artists everywhere to survive.

                     ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIOUS WAYS THEY CREATE INVISIBLE VALUE,
                     SERVICES WOULD MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF OF GLOBAL TRADE
                     In the traditional view, global flows of services in gross terms are much smaller than flows
                     of goods. But as detailed above, the true value of services in trade is obscured in three
                     areas: the value added they contribute to the production of goods, cross-border flows of
                     intangibles, and global access to free digital services.

                     Our analysis suggests that these three channels collectively produce up to $8.3 trillion in
                     value annually—a figure that would increase overall trade flows by $4.0 trillion and reallocate
                     another $4.3 trillion currently counted as part of the flow of goods.

                     If we add our estimates of these three channels to directly observed service flows, the total
                     value of services trade in value-added terms would be an estimated $13.4 trillion, a figure
                     that would exceed the $13.0 trillion value added of goods trade (Exhibit 14). That would
                     mean that services would account for more than half of all value added in global trade.
                     Accounting for intangibles and free digital services would increase trade in services by
                     almost 80 percent, or $4 trillion, in gross terms. It would also increase global trade from
                     28 percent of GDP to 33 percent.

                     This analysis is not meant to present an argument for redefining trade statistics. Our aim is
                     simply to highlight the hidden scope of services in trade flows and the global economy.

                     Technology has expanded the range of services that can be delivered digitally—and it will
                     continue to do so in the future. The build-out of 5G, for example, paves the way for more
                     types of healthcare services to be delivered across borders. These networks are 20 times
                     faster than 4G connections, allowing real-time interactions. The speed and bandwidth
                     allowed will revolutionize telemedicine and even allow remote surgical operations via
                     robotics. By connecting patients from around the world with specialized medical care that
                     may not be available locally, it opens up a new form of trade in services.

                     Cloud computing, a $120 billion market in 2017, is already one of the fastest-growing
                     components of IT services trade.78 Providers furnish robust digital infrastructure, and their
                     customers essentially lease the storage space, bandwidth, and software applications
                     in a subscription or pay-as-you-go model. The biggest cloud providers to date are
                     headquartered in the United States but have large server farms around the world for
                     global customers. Cloud platforms are a pioneering part of a broader trend of “as a
                     service” business models that shift customers away from purchasing assets and into
                     subscription models for a stream of services (see Box 2, “The rise of ‘anything as a service’
                     business models”).

                     Furthermore, increasingly sophisticated communications and file-sharing technologies are
                     enabling more remote work, reducing the need for in-person meetings and collaboration.
                     This could pave the way for more internationally dispersed teams, globalizing the market
                     for talent and knowledge work. Technologies such as remote file sharing and video
                     conferencing, and collaboration platforms like Slack have been driving this shift for years.
                     Online labor platforms such as Upwork help companies find independent contractors
                     wherever they may be. Now companies such as STRIVR and Doghead Simulations are
                     going even further by developing virtual reality tools for training sessions and meetings,
                     with participants wearing headsets and working together in virtual spaces. These tools can
                     replace some people flows with digital flows.

                     Although it is possible that deployment of automation and AI could reduce the roughly
                     $160 billion global market for business process outsourcing, one of the most heavily traded
                     service sectors, the net effect of new technologies is likely to be an increase in traded
                     services. Chapter 4 analyzes a number of specific new technologies in detail and explores
                     their potential impact on trade in both goods and services.

                                                                              •••

                     Services often play an invisible role in creating value that moves across the world’s borders.
                     Considering their full scope reveals the shift that is under way to a more knowledge-
                     intensive and digital economy. In the chapters that follow, we analyze two of the biggest
                     drivers of change in the current landscape of trade: shifts within the Chinese economy and
                     the adoption of next-generation technologies.

                            Box 2. The rise of “anything as a service” business models
                            The traditional lines separating physical products and services have begun to
                            blur as more and more companies make the shift from thinking of themselves
                            strictly as makers of goods and begin introducing more service offerings. The
                            rise of “anything as a service” means that customers can opt to replace large
                            one-time capital investments with smaller and more distributed payments to
                            use the service in question. “IT as a service” (ITaaS) is the most established
                            model, making up around a quarter of the IT services market in the United
                            States and still growing briskly. It represents a shift from companies building
                            their own IT infrastructure and departments to contracting with service
                            providers for all or part of their business technology needs. This enables
                            companies to purchase only the hardware, software, and support services
                            they actually need. Salesforce, for example, offers its suite of cloud-based
                            customer relationship management tools on a subscription basis. Adobe and
                            other software providers have pivoted away from one-time software sales
                            to offering subscription-based services that can incorporate updates more
                            flexibly. Instead of requiring major capital expenditures that lock consumers
                            and companies into yesterday’s tools for the long term, subscriptions models
                            reduce operating costs and enable providers to offer a steady stream of
                            upgrades and greater flexibility.

                            The “as a service” model has moved well beyond IT, encouraging people to
                            shift away from goods consumption to more flexible options. The ubiquitous
                            availability of ride-sharing services in major cities, for example, changes
                            the economics of personal vehicle ownership for some people. Car leasing
                            continues to grow as a share of new vehicle sales. In 2016, 31 percent of new
                            vehicle sales in the United States were leases, up from 20 percent a decade
                            earlier.1 Broader changes are yet to come in transportation services. Several
                            startups have begun experimenting with mobility as a service, integrating all
                            modes of transportation into a single application with subscription models.
                            Whim, for example, allows customers to pay a flat subscription fee in exchange
                            for unlimited access to car rentals, taxis, city bikes, and public transit.

                            “As-a-service” business models are gaining steam in other consumer-facing
                            industries as well. Streaming services became the top-selling music format
                            in the United States in 2016, generating $2.3 billion in paid subscriptions—far
                            outweighing $1.2 billion in CD sales. Adjusted for inflation, sales of CDs in 2017
                            were at their lowest level since 1985, the second year they were available.2
                            Even fashion and clothing can now be rented instead of bought, using
                            platforms such as Rent the Runway and Le Tote.

                            While many of these types of services are delivered locally, they can contribute
                            to trade when the lessor and renter are in different countries and when the
                            services being piloted are replicated in international markets. Given that
                            many of the services that substitute for goods are digitally enabled (including
                            streaming, car sharing, and taxi and rental apps), their growth will also
                            contribute to cross-border data flows.

3. SHIFTING GLOBAL DEMAND AND
THE NEW CHINA EFFECT
One of the most profound changes of the past half century was China’s emergence as a
hub for global trade. From 1995 to 2007, global value chains in virtually all goods-producing
industries expanded as companies increasingly sourced inputs and produced goods in
China and other developing countries. Because of its enormous market, its investment in
industrial capacity, and its rapidly expanding capabilities, China gradually assumed a greater
share of the world’s production. Today it accounts for 20 percent of all goods production
in global value chains, up from just 4 percent in 1995. The share produced in all other
developing countries has also risen, from 19 percent to 26 percent.

Yet trade patterns are not static. As discussed in Chapter 1, nearly all goods-producing
value chains have become less trade-intensive over the last decade. This trend was masked
during the Great Recession and anemic recovery; many observers expected trade to return
to “normal” patterns once economies around the world got past the crisis. But today, a
decade after the crisis, it is clear that global value chains and trade patterns have structurally
changed. Goods-producing value chains are less trade-intensive; services have assumed
greater importance in trade; trade based on labor-cost arbitrage is declining across many
value chains, while all are becoming more knowledge-intensive; and intraregional trade
is growing.

These shifts are occurring for three main reasons. First, China and other developing
economies have become drivers of global demand growth, leading them to consume more
of what they produce. China alone went from 4 percent of the world’s consumption in 2007
to 10 percent just a decade later. Second, emerging economies are reaching a new level
of industrial maturity. They are building out domestic supply chains and exporting fewer of
the intermediate inputs they need to keep their factories humming. China is progressing
rapidly in this regard as it modernizes multiple industries and strengthens its capabilities in
design, engineering, and high-tech manufacturing. Finally, new technologies are altering
trade patterns by changing the economics of production, creating new goods, and reducing
transaction costs.

This chapter analyzes rising demand and the creation of domestic value chains in China and
other developing countries—shifts that together explain the recent decline in trade intensity
at the global level. This drop is not a sign that globalization is over, nor does it mean that the
world economy is in peril. It reflects an ongoing evolution. Economies generally become
more self-sustaining as they grow (and in the case of China, any country with a very large
land mass and population will naturally trade across national borders less than a small
country). The world is still full of trade opportunities for companies that keep abreast of how
markets are changing.

GLOBAL DEMAND IS SHIFTING TO DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
Over the past quarter century, more than a billion people worldwide have exited poverty.
As their incomes rise, many of them are passing the point at which they can begin to make
significant discretionary purchases and join the consuming class. Not only have millions of
households gained spending power for the first time, but millions more are moving up into
higher income segments, passing the point at which consumption accelerates sharply.
One recent study estimates that the global middle class had expanded to 3.2 billion people
as of 2016 and posits that we have almost reached a tipping point at which middle-class


                                 or affluent households account for a majority of the world’s population for the first time
                                 in history.79

                                 In the years ahead, emerging economies are projected to be the world’s fastest-growing
                                 pockets of demand. By 2030, overall global consumption is forecast to reach $106 trillion,
                                 twice its 2017 level, with 60 percent of this increase coming from the developing world
                                 (Exhibit 15). McKinsey estimates that emerging markets will likely consume almost two-
                                 thirds of the world’s manufactured goods by 2025, with products such as cars, building
                                 products, and machinery leading the way.80 The map of global demand, once heavily tilted
                                 toward advanced economies, is being completely redrawn—and global value chains are
                                 reconfiguring accordingly. While China is the largest part of this story, other developing
                                 countries also play a role.

By 2030, developing countries, led by China and emerging Asia, could account for more than half of
global consumption.

58              McKinsey Global Institute         3. Shifting global demand and the new China effect


                            With domestic consumption rising, Chinese companies can serve local
                            customers rather than exporting
                            Despite recent indicators of slowing growth, China has given rise to a vast middle class
                            that is an engine of global demand. Previous MGI research highlighted China’s working-
                            age population as a key consumer demographic. At current projections, it could account
                            for 12 cents of every $1 of worldwide urban consumption by 2030.81 More recent
                            McKinsey research specifically highlighted the “post-90s” generation, which has grown
                            up with unprecedented wealth, greater exposure to Western culture, and access to new
                            technologies. This group will likely account for more than 20 percent of China’s total
                            consumption growth through 2030.82

                            As it reaches the point of having more millionaires than any other country in the world, China
                            now represents roughly a third of the global market for luxury goods, with an estimated
                            $7.4 billion in annual spending. By 2025, McKinsey projects that it could account for
                            44 percent of the total global market for luxury goods. In 2016, luxury purchases were made
                            by an estimated 7.6 million Chinese households—more than the total number of households
                            in all of Malaysia or the Netherlands. On average, those households spent twice as much on
                            luxury items as French or Italian households.83

                            China’s consumers have turned the country into the largest market for online retail in the
                            world. The best illustration of this is the explosive growth of “Singles Day,” a one-day annual
                            frenzy of e-commerce that rang up an estimated $30 billion in sales in 2018, far surpassing
                            Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States combined.

                            The nation’s consumption is equally remarkable when viewed through the lens of specific
                            product categories. China became the world’s largest market for automobiles in 2009 and
                            has continued to grow at double-digit rates each year. In 2016, 40 percent more cars were
                            sold in China than in all of Europe (although vehicle sales have since declined).84 China’s
                            smartphone market is also the largest in the world, with 444 million shipments in 2017.85 The
                            rise of Chinese smartphone brands such as Vivo and Oppo, mainly sold domestically, is a
                            testament to the growth of Chinese consumption. China now accounts for 40 percent of the
                            world’s consumption in textiles and apparel, 28 percent in automotive, and 38 percent in
                            computers and electronics.

                            As a result of this demand growth, more of what gets made in China is now sold in China.
                            Within the industry value chains we studied, China exported 17 percent of the gross output
                            it produced in 2007. By 2017, it was exporting just 9 percent of its output. This is roughly on
                            a par with the United States, but a far smaller share than in Germany (34 percent), South
                            Korea (28 percent), or Japan (14 percent).

                                 Other developing countries are also consuming more of what they produce
                                 Consumption is also rising more broadly across the rest of the developing world as more
                                 countries urbanize, industrialize, and plug into global value chains. By 2030, the developing
                                 world outside of China is projected to account for 35 percent of global consumption (see
                                 Exhibit 15, above). Demand is growing in countries including India, Indonesia, Thailand,
                                 Malaysia, and the Philippines.

                                 The trend of developing countries consuming more of what they produce is most apparent
                                 in labor-intensive and global innovations value chains (Exhibit 16). Between 2007 and 2017,
                                 the share of output in these value chains that is exported dropped by more than half in China
                                 (from 29 to 15 percent) and declined from 33 to 27 percent in other developing economies,
                                 excluding Europe. Developing Europe (which includes the Czech Republic, Poland, and
                                 Romania, among others) is the only region that defies this trend; those countries are
                                 important suppliers for Western Europe.


Exhibit 16

A larger share of output is being consumed domestically in emerging markets, except developing Europe.

                                 Decreased trade intensity in industries like apparel reflects rising incomes and demand in
                                 countries that have taken on more of the world’s labor-intensive manufacturing. At its peak in
                                 2002, India, for example, exported 35 percent of its final output in apparel. But by 2017, that
                                 figure was down to 17 percent—not because India lost its share of the global export market,
                                 but because Indian apparel makers, like their counterparts in China, no longer need to
                                 ship as many of their products halfway around the world to find buyers. They can sell more
                                 garments to local consumers. India’s average spending on apparel and footwear rose from
                                 $40 per person in 2007 to $64 in 2017, with population growth expanding the market at the
                                 same time.

                                 Growing consumption in the developing world creates export opportunities
                                 As global demand shifts to the developing world, new opportunities are opening for
                                 producers in advanced economies. In 1995, only 3 percent of exports from advanced
                                 economies went to China, but that share was up to 12 percent by 2017 as exports rose from
                                 $130 billion to $1.2 trillion. Over the same period, the share of advanced-economy exports
                                 going to other developing countries grew from 20 to 29 percent, climbing in absolute terms
                                 from $860 billion to $3 trillion (Exhibit 17). This trend occurred in both final goods and
                                 intermediate goods.

                     In the automotive industry, for instance, Japan, Germany, and the United States send
                     38 percent of their exports of auto parts and cars to China and the rest of the developing
                     world. In knowledge-intensive services, including IT services, financial services, and
                     business services, 45 percent of all exports from advanced economies go to the developing
                     world. China’s imports of final goods now match those of Germany and exceed those of
                     Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia.

                     Over the past decade, growing exports to the developing world helped advanced
                     economies mitigate the impact of weak demand at home, which persisted for years after
                     the Great Recession. In industries such as furniture and apparel, France, Germany, and the
                     United States saw demand from their advanced economy trading partners fall from 2007 to
                     2017, but rising exports to the developing world cushioned the blow.

                     The Asia–Pacific region is already a top strategic priority for many Western brands. Danish
                     brewer Carlsberg, for example, recently reported flat revenue growth in Western Europe but
                     double-digit growth in Asian markets (most notably India).86 Cosmetics giant Estée Lauder
                     recently reported 2 percent sales growth in the Americas but 11 percent growth in emerging
                     markets, propelled in part by teaming up with local social media influencers such as Chinese
                     actress Yang Mi.87 In the first half of 2018, Hermès reported that the Asia–Pacific region
                     outside of Japan accounted for 38 percent of its revenue—a share that exceeds its revenue
                     in all of Europe.88

                     After several decades of participating in global value chains mainly as producers, developing
                     economies are now important consumers as well. This is not only creating export
                     opportunities for advanced economies; developing countries are also increasingly trading
                     with each other (see Box 3, “China and the expansion of South-South trade”).

                     China’s trade policies have come under criticism from other countries, however. According
                     to WTO data, China’s average tariffs on imported goods are double the EU’s average tariff
                     rate and three times higher than the US average, not having significantly changed over the
                     past decade.89 Other points of contention include restricted foreign access to some Chinese
                     markets, subsidies for key domestic industries, and restrictions on foreign data flows.
                     Among the biggest areas of concern for foreign companies are technology transfer and IP
                     protection and enforcement. In some markets, China allows foreign companies to enter only
                     through joint ventures with Chinese companies. While this has been an effective strategy
                     for rapidly building new industries and capabilities, joint ventures can be mechanisms for

                                 Box 3. China and the expansion of South-South trade
                                 Today, developing economies are counterparts on more than 40 percent of the world’s trade
                                 in goods—and increasingly, they are trading with one another (Exhibit 18). This so-called
                                 South-South trade currently stands at $3.6 trillion. It represents almost half of all exports
                                 from developing countries, up from 39 percent a decade ago.

                                 China accounts for 29 percent of the exports from all developing economies—and it
                                 increasingly sells to trading partners across the developing world, not just to advanced
                                 economies. Its exports to developing economies soared from $42 billion in 2000 to
                                 $800 billion in 2017; they now constitute 22 percent of all South-South trade. China is
                                 Africa’s largest trading partner. Its goods trade with Africa is more than triple the amount
                                 Africa trades with India, France, the United States, or Germany. Economic growth in some
                                 African economies is dependent on China; half of exports from Angola, for instance, go to
                                 China.1 China is financing infrastructure and construction projects in multiple developing
                                 countries with an eye toward opening new markets for Chinese manufactured goods.

                                 Chinese imports from other developing countries rose from $50 billion in 2000 to $727 billion
                                 in 2017. Although commodities such as oil, iron ore, and soybeans make up 37 percent of
                                 these imports, China also sources a range of other goods, both intermediate and final, from
                                 across the developing world. Yet as of 2017, China’s surplus with other developing countries
                                 stood at $75 billion.

                                 CHINA AND OTHER DEVELOPING ECONOMIES ARE BUILDING DOMESTIC
                                 SUPPLY CHAINS
                                 In many industries, companies see an advantage in placing production close to their
                                 customers and building networks of suppliers in closer proximity to one another to improve
                                 coordination. We see production networks deepening in developing countries as local
                                 industries become more vertically integrated and multinationals build out foreign affiliates
                                 to serve these fast-growing markets. This trend is taking hold in countries including China,
                                 India, and Indonesia.

                                 China, which drove the expansion of global value chains, has now developed
                                 more comprehensive domestic supply chains
                                 Soon after China entered the WTO in 2001, its manufacturing output began to soar. Its
                                 share of overall global goods production, which stood at 6 percent in 1995, rose rapidly
                                 to hit 16 percent in 2007 and 32 percent by 2017 (Exhibit 19). Automotive, transportation
                                 equipment, and computers and electronics saw especially large increases. China now
                                 produces almost half of global output in three industries: glass, cement, and ceramics;
                                 electrical machinery; and textiles and apparel.

                            China’s rise in global trade began with importing intermediate goods and re-exporting
                            assembled products to the world. In the past decade, however, it has developed more
                            comprehensive domestic supply chains and more vertically integrated industries, with
                            homegrown companies stepping into many new market niches.

                            As China builds new industrial capacity, it is modernizing industries at the same time,
                            phasing out aging factories and building more technologically advanced new plants.
                            In computers and electronics, for instance, China first emerged as a place for low-cost
                            assembly and re-export. Now China is developing its own capabilities to manufacture
                            components, including sophisticated chips that it previously imported from advanced
                            economies. Xiaomi, for instance, launched a homegrown chip in 2017 with Chinese-based
                            subsidiary Pinecone.91 Foxconn has established a new base in the inland province of Henan;
                            Intel and Hewlett Packard have done the same in Sichuan (see Box 4, “China’s industrial
                            growth moves inland,” for more on this trend).

                                 February 28, 2017.




                            Box 4. China’s industrial growth moves inland
                            Building out domestic supply chains is enabling China to bring new jobs to its inland
                            provinces—regions that did not make the same kind of economic gains as the coastal
                            provinces during the recent export-led boom. Today, with the coastal provinces enjoying
                            greater prosperity than ever before, the next generation no longer aspires to the same
                            kind of factory jobs that their parents regarded as their ticket to a better life. China is now
                            focusing on economic development in parts of the country that were left behind, and it has
                            invested heavily in transportation infrastructure (including high-speed rail) to move goods
                            and people from the heartland to the coast. In undertaking this policy, China hopes to take
                            some of the pressure off its biggest megacities and encourage more balanced development
                            across a greater number of smaller cities.

                            Wages in Chinese coastal provinces have been rising above the going rates in other
                            developing countries, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. But China can retain many types
                            of manufacturing by moving production inland. In essence, Chinese companies can engage
                            in labor-cost arbitrage within the country’s own borders. In 2016, the prevailing annual wage
                            for a factory worker in the coastal province of Jiangsu was 67,000 RMB, but it was just
                            under 50,000 RMB in the inland provinces of Jiangxi and Yunnan (figures not adjusted for
                            productivity differences).

                            The “Made in China 2025” policy designates dozens of inland pilot cities for industrial
                            upgrades. Hefei, for instance, has an existing base of appliance manufacturing, and it
                            benefits from the presence of the Hefei State High-Tech Industry Development Zone and
                            the University of Science and Technology of China. Now the city is branching out into areas
                            such as voice-recognition technology and next-generation vehicles.1

                                 As a result of China’s growing domestic supply chains, its trade intensity has fallen. The
                                 same trend can be observed to a lesser degree in other developing countries, such as
                                 India and Brazil, but China’s size ensures that its economic shifts register at the global level
                                 (Exhibit 20).

                                 This new China effect explains the entirety of the recent slowdown in goods trade that has
                                 been observed at the global level. The steepest fall-off in China’s intermediate trade has
                                 occurred in computers and electronics (Exhibit 21). Measured as a share of global output,
                                 trade in intermediate inputs fell by 5.1 percentage points between 2007 and 2017. China fully
                                 accounted for the fall; in fact, trade in intermediate inputs actually expanded slightly among
                                 other countries participating in this value chain. The industry’s overall trade intensity (that
                                 is, exports of intermediate and final goods as a share of gross output) fell sharply over the
                                 decade as China’s industry became more vertically integrated and more of the computers,
                                 phones, and devices it turns out were sold to Chinese consumers rather than being
                                 shipped abroad.

                                 The automotive industry’s global trade intensity similarly fell by 7.9 percentage points
                                 between 2007 and 2017. Two-thirds of this decline can be traced to the millions of vehicles
                                 being both made and sold in China. Trade intensity also tumbled by ten percentage points
                                 in the textiles and apparel industry during this period, with China accounting for 80 percent
                                 of the drop. China remains the world’s largest importer and exporter of goods. But in relative
                                 terms, its focus on building domestic supply chains and vertically integrated industries has
                                 dampened the scope of the trading opportunities foreign companies once envisioned.

                                 More comprehensive domestic supply chains are similarly taking root in other
                                 developing economies
                                 The trend toward adding domestic production across more segments of various industry
                                 value chains is most pronounced in China, but it is apparent in other developing economies
                                 as well. Textiles and apparel offers the clearest illustration. In this industry, a growing
                                 emphasis on speed and time to market requires keeping tight coordination between
                                 suppliers at different stages of the value chain. In the developing world outside China, the
                                 share of traded intermediate inputs relative to the industry’s overall output shrank from
                                 18 percent at its peak in 2002 to 13 percent in 2017. Instead of fragmenting production
                                 across multiple far-flung countries, production networks spanning multiple stages are
                                 consolidating within individual countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, India, and
                                 Indonesia. Even Ethiopia, a newer player in textiles production, is beginning to expand its
                                 own cotton production to serve its apparel manufacturers.

                                 Other emerging economies have been developing more extensive supply chains in food and
                                 beverage. In Senegal, for instance, millet was originally grown and processed by individual
                                 households for their own consumption. By the early 2000s, commercial facilities were

                                       processing millet flour. Now Senegal has an initiative to develop more advanced processing
                                       for commercial products such as ready-to-eat millet meals.92

                                       Expansion into new parts of the value chain is playing out differently in various parts of
                                       the developing world (Exhibit 22). In emerging Asia outside of China, strong economic
                                       growth has created robust consumer markets, supporting more self-contained domestic
                                       industries. The region has consistently relied less on imported intermediate inputs than
                                       the rest of the developing world (9.5 percent of goods output in 2017, as opposed to
                                       18.7 percent). In the global innovations category (which includes automotive, chemicals,
                                       machinery, computers, and electronics), the region’s domestic intermediate output grew
                                       by 6 percent annually from 2007 to 2017, and the share of traded intermediate inputs going
                                       into these products dropped by some five percentage points. In global value chains offering
                                       knowledge-intensive services, the region has similarly posted 5 percent annual growth in
                                       output, while the share of traded intermediate inputs supporting that output shrank by 11
                                       percentage points over the decade. Some industries within these countries are becoming
                                       less dependent on foreign suppliers for certain inputs.

                                    Industries in developing Europe, by contrast, are integrating more deeply into the supply
                                    chains of larger advanced economies nearby. In the case of countries like the Czech
                                    Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and Poland, many manufacturers have joined the production
                                    networks of Western European carmakers (especially German firms). Between 2007 and
                                    2017, output climbed by 2 percent annually in the region’s global innovations industries, and
                                    the share of traded intermediate inputs rose by two percentage points. That trend holds true
                                    more broadly across other types of value chains as well.

                                    In industries that manufacture global innovations, multinationals sometimes provide the
                                    momentum that helps developing countries move beyond the assembly stage and into other
                                    types of production since they want to keep more phases of production together. In India’s
                                    automotive manufacturing, for example, imported intermediate inputs fell from 14 percent
                                    of gross output in 2007 to 10.1 percent in 2017 as the presence of multinational carmakers
                                    supported the proliferation of more local specialist suppliers. In 2017, Ford exported 180,000
                                    cars from India, and Hyundai exported another 153,000. Like China, India is producing and
                                    consuming more of what it makes, reducing trade intensity in both final and intermediate
                                    goods (Exhibit 23).

                                    The growing industrial maturity in many developing economies, combined with soaring
                                    demand growth, is already altering the landscape of global trade—and these changes
                                    are likely to become even more pronounced in the years ahead. In the next chapter, we
                                    look at another major shift that is well under way and soon to accelerate: a wave of new
                                    technologies that will change how things are made, where they are made, and even the
                                    products that are traded.

4. THE NEXT WAVE OF TECHNOLOGIES
IN GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS
Global value chains as we know them today could not exist without technology. The
previous wave of digital technologies—from instant communications to supply chain
management software—reduced barriers of distance and complexity, enabling companies
to interact with suppliers and customers anywhere around the world. By reducing
transaction costs, digital technologies enabled trade in goods and services to soar.

Today a new set of technologies—including advanced robotics, AI, the Internet of Things,
3-D printing, and blockchain—has already begun to penetrate global value chains, and its
impact will grow in the years ahead. Some of these technologies, including digital platforms
and logistics applications, will continue to reduce transaction costs and facilitate trade
flows.93 Automation technologies in manufacturing will change the way goods are made
and the relative cost of different inputs, including labor. This could amplify the trend of more
localized production near key consumer markets. Finally, technology-enabled innovations
such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and augmented and virtual reality can change
the content and patterns of trade flows.

The net impact of these next-generation technologies on trade flows is unclear, but in
some scenarios, they could dampen goods trade and further boost flows of services
and data. As they diffuse through global value chains, they will create openings for new
players and opportunities for incumbents to shift their business models. Different regions
of the world may also be able to develop new competitive advantages. In this chapter, we
take a detailed look at some of these new technologies and their applications for global
production networks.

THE ICT REVOLUTION TRANSFORMED THE PREVIOUS ERA OF
GLOBALIZATION, AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL RESHAPE THE NEXT
Economist Richard Baldwin frames the history of globalization as waves of “unbundling.”94
The first wave came after the Industrial Revolution, when the introduction of steamships
and railroads reduced the cost of moving goods. This changed the economics of buying
things made halfway around the world; think British ladies drinking tea from China or French
chocolatiers turning African-grown cocoa beans into confections. This trend continued
through the 20th century. From 1930 to 2000, the price of shipping fell by approximately
two-thirds.95 Production could now occur far from the final consumer.

Baldwin’s second great unbundling was the more recent ICT revolution, which made it
possible for companies to disaggregate linear production processes—that is, breaking
them into discrete steps and outsourcing some of those steps to external suppliers. Global
value chains existed before the internet, but the internet helped to fuel further fragmentation
and realignment. Many more countries began participating in all types of value chains, and
networks of specialized suppliers and assembly plants sprang up worldwide.

                                  The ICT revolution also paved the way for the explosive growth of cross-border data flows
                                  noted in MGI’s previous research on digital globalization. According to World Bank data,
                                  46 percent of the world is online, up from 20 percent a decade ago. The number of cellular
                                  subscriptions worldwide now exceeds the planet’s population (since many users have
                                  multiple devices). From 2005 to 2017, the amount of cross-border bandwidth in use grew
                                  148 times larger (Exhibit 24). Some of the traffic being carried reflects companies interacting
                                  with their foreign operations, suppliers, and customers.

                                  While ICT and the internet accelerated trade by reducing transaction costs, the next wave of
                                  technologies will have a more varied and complex effect. This chapter examines three major
                                  types of impact (Exhibit 25).

                                   Reducing transaction costs. Some new technologies (including digital platforms
                                     for e-commerce, digital payments, automated document processing, autonomous
                                     vehicles, and the IoT) will smooth transportation, logistics, financing, and search and
                                     coordination—all of which enables increased trade in goods, services, commodities, and
                                     digital flows.96

                                   Altering production processes. Advanced robotics, AI, and analytics are the building
                                     blocks of a more automated and efficient form of digitized manufacturing—and because
                                     they substitute for labor, they may reduce the importance of wage differentials in location
                                     decisions. Additive manufacturing (3-D printing) makes it possible to produce goods
                                     even closer to the end consumer; it also supports speed and customization.

                                   Creating and transforming products. From renewable energy and electric vehicles

                                  DIGITAL PLATFORMS, THE IOT, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO
                                  REDUCE TRANSACTION COSTS, FUELING ALL TYPES OF FLOWS
                                  The costs of transportation and logistics, financing, and search and coordination, as well
                                  as time in transit, are among the biggest barriers to trade. But digital platforms, logistics
                                  technologies, and data-processing technologies reduce these frictions.

                                  Digital platforms create new markets and reduce coordination costs
                                  Digital platforms for e-commerce, social media, payments, travel, learning, and labor
                                  services connect buyers and sellers directly, lowering the costs of search and coordination
                                  between buyers and sellers.97

                                  E-commerce has already enabled significant cross-border flows by aggregating huge
                                  selections and making pricing and comparisons more transparent.98 It has also reduced the
                                  impact of distance on trade flows.99 Alibaba’s AliResearch projects that cross-border B2C
                                  e-commerce alone will grow to approximately $1 trillion by 2020 (Exhibit 26). Cross-border
                                  B2B e-commerce is likely to be several times larger.

                                       Defining what qualifies as e-commerce can be challenging. The broadest definition would include any
                                       transaction that takes place on an online portal. E-commerce platforms can offer some or all of the following
                                       functions: matching customers to suppliers, facilitating ordering, accepting payments, and coordinating
                                       delivery. The matching component is the most relevant for increasing trade.

                            As a result of these platforms, the number of parcels sent by postal services internationally
                            rose by more than 80 percent between 2010 and 2017. This growth has implications for
                            customs processing. The WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, which came into effect in
                            2017, is a first step in harmonizing and streamlining customs procedures. One study found
                            that its implementation could significantly reduce trade costs, with developing economies
                            standing to gain the most.100 The continuation of small-parcel trade fueled by e-commerce
                            has come into question, however. The United States recently announced its withdrawal
                            from the Universal Postal Union agreement, a 144-year-old treaty that allowed companies
                            in China and the rest of the developing world to ship small packages to the United States at
                            discounted rates.

                            While B2C e-commerce marketplaces are well known, a growing number of B2B platforms
                            have been springing up—and all can facilitate more cross-border transactions. Xometry, for
                            example, provides a marketplace for on-demand manufacturing capacity. EC21, a South
                            Korean platform that serves 3.5 million monthly users globally, offers B2B e-commerce
                            across a wide range of products. It recently partnered with Payoneer, an international
                            payment platform, to integrate escrow services that secure transactions for businesses.

                            Digital platforms offer small and medium-size companies exposure to international
                            customers as well as the services and support they may need to grow, including funding,
                            talent, and marketing tools. Sites such as Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer.com, and Maistro
                            connect freelancers around the world with clients in need of services such as coding,
                            website development, graphic design, and marketing. The ability to turn to digital platforms
                            for specialized help on an as-needed basis lowers the barriers to starting a business.101

                            The Internet of Things, blockchain, and automation can improve logistics
                            Improving the time and cost of logistics contributes to increased trade.102 Today a range of
                            new technologies promises to revolutionize the way goods are sent around the world.

                            First, the Internet of Things creates the ability to monitor and control objects in the
                            physical world.103 As it is more widely adopted, Cisco estimates that machine-to-machine
                            connections will account for 51 percent of global devices and connections by 2021
                            (Exhibit 27). The IoT can speed the flow of goods by tracking shipments and routing delivery
                            trucks based on current road conditions. An application called SenseAware, for example,
                            monitors the location, temperature, and humidity of international shipments in real time.

                                  Automated document processing can help to speed goods through customs. Digital
                                  documents can be scanned for keywords and automatically checked against requirements
                                  for customs clearance. The World Bank found that shipments can clear the average fully
                                  electronic customs process in around 25 hours, compared to more than 80 hours for
                                  paper-based procedures.104 This could be a leap forward for many developing countries. A
                                  shipment of imports entering India takes an average of 61 hours to go through documentary
                                  compliance, while border compliance takes 265 hours. Both of these steps take one hour
                                  of less in Germany.105 Some AI applications can also help to reduce errors rates in customs
                                  processing and overcome language barriers.106

                                  Autonomous vehicles have substantial potential in logistics. A fleet of self-driving trucks
                                  run by Embark is hauling appliance deliveries from Texas to California. Other companies
                                  (including Volvo, Daimler, Tesla, Uber, and Waymo) also have robo-trucking business lines
                                  in development.107 Automated cranes and guided vehicles are being deployed in ports
                                  from Rotterdam to Singapore to Long Beach; China is close to opening a fully autonomous
                                  harbor port, Caofeidian. Autonomous vehicles are also being tested at London’s Heathrow
                                  and Gatwick airports to assist with cargo handling on airfields.

                                  Although it is an ominous sign of global warming, the Northern Sea Route from Alaska to

                            the Northern Sea Route. It is still a perilous undertaking, however, relying on a new breed
                            of ice-class container ships built with advanced materials (with Russian nuclear-powered
                            icebreakers on call if needed).108 Russia is also developing unmanned ships to ply this route.
                            In air transportation, possibilities include planes made from advanced materials such as
                            lightweight graphene, and electric-powered planes.

                            Blockchain technologies also have potential to reduce trade costs while creating the
                            transparency and trust needed to underpin international transactions.109 Maersk and IBM
                            have developed a blockchain shipping solution called TradeLens. In a pilot conducted on
                            flower exports from Kenya to the Netherlands, it reduced transit times by 40 percent, with
                            confirmations delivered every step of the way. Yet it will be some time before the scalability
                            and success of blockchain technologies in trade can be determined.

                            Blockchain can also be used to create “smart contracts,” replacing paper-based
                            documentation systems in trade finance. Transactions can be executed immediately
                            when goods are received, and every party can be alerted at each stage of the journey.
                            Because transactions are permanently recorded in a distributed ledger (that is, confirmed
                            by consensus), they are less susceptible to tampering, which provides an additional layer of
                            security.110 HSBC recently executed what may be the world’s first trade-finance transaction
                            on blockchain, using a single, shared digital application for a shipment of soybeans from
                            Argentina to Malaysia. The exchange was completed in 24 hours, compared to the usual five
                            to ten days it typically takes with a paper-based system.111

                            AUTOMATION, AI, AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING CHANGE PRODUCTION
                            PROCESSES AND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INPUTS
                            Automation technologies, including advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and additive
                            manufacturing, alter production processes—and the economics of production.

                            Automation enhances quality and efficiency while diminishing the importance
                            of labor costs
                            Automation systems and advanced robotics can make a range of production processes
                            more efficient and precise. The diffusion of these technologies and their productivity
                            benefits through entire industries and national economies will have ramifications for the way
                            global value chains are organized.

                            The work activities that lend themselves to automation tend to be physical and repetitive, or
                            cognitive tasks that can be clearly codified. Previous MGI research found that in the United
                            States, for example, the industries with the highest automation potential are manufacturing,
                            accommodation and food services, and transportation and warehousing (Exhibit 28).

                            Companies consider a range of factors before adopting automation technologies, including
                            the costs of the systems themselves, the transition costs, the relative cost of labor, the
                            strength of the business case, customer acceptance, and regulation.112 Where technology
                            systems are expensive and labor is cheap, they feel less urgency. But the price of robots
                            has fallen by more than half since 1990, and as demand for robots grows, cost will continue
                            to become less of a barrier.113 Adoption is likely to be much greater in advanced economies
                            than in developing economies. Previous MGI research found that in a midrange adoption

                                   Originally developed for producing goods made of metal, plastics, and wood, robots in
                                   manufacturing can now handle a wider variety of processes and industries. They can
                                   even cut and sew delicate materials. SoftWear Automation, an Atlanta-based startup, is
                                   developing a line of “sewbots” that can automate textile production, for example.

                                   In value chains producing labor-intensive goods and global innovations, a significant
                                   share of trade flows from developing to advanced economies. But because automation
                                   technologies reduce the importance of labor costs, companies may decide to shift some
                                   production closer to end markets in advanced economies. This is not yet happening on
                                   a significant scale, although there are a few cases. This trend is most likely to take root in
                                   industries where speed to market is an important factor.

                                   A prime example is fashion and apparel. Taking advantage of customer insights requires
                                   rapid turnaround times in manufacturing and distribution, and it favors locating apparel
                                   manufacturing closer to the consumer. In a survey of US and EU purchasing managers,

                            54 percent said that geographic proximity is becoming more important, and another
                            22 percent said it may be more important in the coming years.115 More than half of
                            Zara’s thousands of suppliers, for instance, are concentrated in Spain, Portugal, Turkey,
                            and Morocco to serve the European market.116 Adidas is building new automated
                            “Speedfactories” in Germany and the United States to produce athletic shoes that were
                            traditionally hand sewn in Indonesia.

                            Automation in manufacturing will not necessarily cause an exodus of production from the
                            developing world.117 Because it can reduce error rates in production, improve product
                            quality, and boost output, it could help some developing economies develop a competitive
                            edge that extends beyond low-wage labor. China is pursuing automation in manufacturing
                            as a strategy to retain its share of global production even as wages rise. Foxconn, for
                            instance, plans to upgrade its plants across China with next-generation robots and high-
                            resolution sensors to spot defects that human eyes cannot see.118 Thailand’s industrial
                            robotics industry has expanded, with 133 percent growth in shipments of industrial robots
                            between 2013 and 2018.119 One of the country’s key adopters is the Thai Beverage Group,
                            which set up a subsidiary called BevTech to develop robots and automation technologies to
                            support its operations.120 Furthermore, some production could be “nearshored” rather than
                            reshored—that is, based in neighboring middle-income countries that offer a combination
                            of relatively lower wages and geographic proximity. Wherever it is based, a more automated
                            and digital form of manufacturing no longer requires a large, low-skill workforce. (See
                            Chapter 6 for more on this topic.)

                            Artificial intelligence and virtual agents could reduce trade in back-
                            office services
                            Automation technologies are a broader set of tools than simple industrial robots in factories.
                            Many back-office processes in areas such as finance and accounting, human resources,
                            and IT support involve repetitive tasks that can be automated with artificial intelligence.

                            Many call center and help desk activities are already “staffed” by virtual agents, which are
                            progressing from rule-based bots to models with natural language processing abilities.
                            IPSoft’s Amelia, for example, is a “cognitive agent” platform for handling customer service,
                            drawing business intelligence from interactions, and passing requests into the right
                            workflow.121 It took 140 human representatives to handle the more than 65,000 monthly
                            calls that came into one media company’s customer service center, but Amelia was able
                            to handle two-thirds of that volume—and it reduced the average resolution time from 18
                            minutes to just five.

                            MGI’s automation model finds that up to 80 percent of the work activities in business and
                            IT services could theoretically be performed by machines (although companies will not
                            necessarily adopt to that degree). Given that business process outsourcing services involve
                            many repetitive tasks such as data entry, they have even higher potential. Today BPO is one
                            of the most heavily traded service sectors, but companies in advanced economies could
                            begin to use AI tools to handle these functions rather than offshoring them. Yet countries

                     that are already leaders in BPO services (such as India, Costa Rica, and the Philippines)
                     could retain their position or even expand their markets if they can use AI themselves to
                     improve the quality and cost of BPO services or deliver higher-value services.

                     AI can also create trade in new types of services. Algorithms “learn” by reviewing vast
                     quantities of data that humans have already labeled. Tagging data for machine learning
                     could become a significant source of work in lower-wage countries in the coming years.
                     Outsourcing companies such as US-based Samasource are already developing these
                     capabilities for computer vision and natural language recognition.

                     Additive manufacturing could reduce trade in replacement parts and in
                     manufactured goods
                     Additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing, builds physical objects based on graphical data
                     input from computers, adding layers of raw materials to match the intended design. It frees
                     designers to create products with better performance, new features, or reduced weight.
                     Because objects can be created at the point of use (for example, a construction site, mining
                     operation, or factory), production is dispersed and more nimble. It may also require less
                     working capital.122

                     Additive manufacturing can be used to produce objects according to highly detailed
                     specifications—and even enable products that could not have been built with traditional
                     manufacturing. GE and CFM International adopted additive manufacturing to develop a
                     complex fuel nozzle for a jet engine, combining 20 parts into a single unit with 25 percent
                     less weight.123 The technology has multiple healthcare applications, including patient-
                     specific implants that enable higher success rates and reduce time in surgery.

                     Additive manufacturing could dampen trade in some goods as on-demand production near
                     the consumer replaces the global distribution of mass-produced goods. Toybox, a home-
                     based 3-D printer, enables customers to design their own toys or purchase specifications
                     from the printer maker’s web catalog. With consumers making the final product in their own
                     homes, trade in toys decreases, but data flows and IP charges for designs increase.

                     In some cases, additive manufacturing could spur trade by enabling customization that
                     generates more consumer demand. After producing 100,000 pairs in 2018, Adidas
                     aims to produce millions of Futurecraft 4D athletic shoes with 3-D-printed custom soles
                     in the coming years. Today virtually all hearing aids are 3-D printed—and World Bank
                     research finds that trade in hearing aids has increased 60 percent since 3-D printing was
                     introduced.124 The countries that moved into this specialty first (Switzerland, Denmark,
                     and Singapore) remain large exporters, and they have been joined by China, Mexico,
                     and Vietnam.

                     Most experts believe that additive manufacturing will not replace mass production for many
                     types of goods over the next decade, if ever, due to technical limitations and the fact that the
                     cost and speed are not competitive for large volumes. Its greatest promise is in prototyping,
                     replacement parts, and products that require customization. Only very limited trade flows
                     will likely be affected by the use of 3-D printing to move production closer to the point
                     of consumption.

                                  TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING THE GOODS AND SERVICES TRADED
                                  ACROSS BORDERS
                                  In addition to changes in transaction costs and factor costs, technology is transforming
                                  some products and services as well as giving rise to some entirely new ones. These may
                                  change both the content and volume of trade flows. Here we look at the effects of digital
                                  goods, electric vehicles, and 5G wireless networks.

                                  Some digital innovations replace trade in goods with service and data flows
                                  As some goods are digitized, they become more tradable—and may even be transformed
                                  into flows of data and services. This trend began with music, video, and games and
                                  is now moving into cloud computing, 3-D printing, and, increasingly, “as a service”
                                  business models.

                                  For years, books, movies, games, music, and media content have been moving away
                                  from physical printed copies to digital files that can be sold at near-zero cost to customers
                                  anywhere in the world. More recently, these products have morphed yet again from stand-
                                  alone digital files to streaming and subscription models. Consumption of mobile audio
                                  and online audio has grown by 23 and 14 percent, respectively, over the past decade.125
                                  Revenues from music streaming more than doubled between 2015 and 2017, and they now
                                  account for nearly 40 percent of global recorded music revenues (Exhibit 29). More than half
                                  of Netflix’s 118 million subscribers are outside the United States. An online streaming service
                                  launched by Baidu, iQiyi, recently averaged 420 million mobile monthly viewers.126

McKinsey Global Institute         Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains                                                  81


                     Cloud computing uses a similar subscription or pay-as-you-go model. Many businesses
                     turn to cloud providers for a seamless package of storage, business software, and regular
                     upgrades rather than building their own IT infrastructure. This frees them from making heavy
                     capital investments and locking into systems that can quickly become outdated. Spending
                     on cloud services is expected to grow at more than six times the rate of general IT spending
                     through 2020.127

                     Cloud computing is one aspect of a broader trend toward leasing assets or purchasing
                     services on demand. The rise of on-demand ride sharing is projected to reduce car
                     ownership substantially, while increasing utilization of each vehicle. McKinsey has estimated
                     that ride sharing could offset a third of the growth in auto sales by 2030.128 This could have
                     large implications for the entire automotive industry, shifting value from vehicle sales to after-
                     sales services.

                     Overall, the rise of digital goods tends to shift value from manufacturing to service provision
                     and distribution. Value creation within industries is migrating to upstream R&D and
                     design and to downstream distribution and marketing. In the case of digital goods, the
                     manufacturing processes in the middle of the value chain disappear altogether.

                     Growth in electric vehicles and renewable resources could reduce trade in auto
                     parts and commodities
                     Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining momentum, particularly in China, the United States, and
                     Europe. In 2017, global sales of electric and hybrid vehicles topped one million for the first
                     time. McKinsey estimates that battery-powered EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs will make up
                     17 percent of global car sales by 2030, up from approximately 1 percent in 2017.129 This
                     trend will be driven by regulatory pushes, new models, and falling battery prices.

                     The adoption of EVs could disrupt automotive value chains and trade. Battery-powered EVs
                     have only 20 to 30 moving parts in their drivetrains, compared to 130 to 170 moving parts
                     in an internal combustion engine. We estimate that EVs could reduce trade in auto parts
                     (which totals some $700 billion today) by up to 10 percent while also reducing demand for
                     crude oil and petroleum (Exhibit 30).

                     But the shift to EVs could also generate new flows within automotive value chains. Trade
                     in batteries will depend on how the footprint of battery manufacturing evolves in the next
                     few years; it is likely to mirror existing regional networks. Battery manufacturing was
                     previously concentrated in China, Japan, and South Korea. Now Tesla has established its
                     Gigafactory for battery production in the United States. Other battery plants are already
                     under development in Hungary, Poland, Thailand, and Morocco. Trade in raw materials for
                     batteries, such as nickel, cobalt, and copper, could also increase.

                     tested (including splashy demonstrations at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in South Korea
                     and the 2018 Super Bowl in Minneapolis). With connections that are roughly 20 times faster
                     than 4G, 5G will embed the internet into the world around us like electricity. Ultrafast speeds
                     and reliability will provide a backbone for the IoT, smarter grids, autonomous vehicles, and
                     virtual reality to realize more of their potential.131

                     The rollout of 5G may reshape global flows in complex ways. Virtual reality and virtual
                     meetings, which are subject to technology snags of all kinds today, could be run more
                     smoothly and with new possibilities for interactivity and presentations. Shared documents,
                     sophisticated visualizations, and even holograms could be transmitted instantly—all of
                     which reduces the need for workers to travel for business meetings.

                     In industrial plants, 5G can support augmented and virtual reality–based remote
                     maintenance. Intelligent video surveillance combined with AI-based video recognition
                     algorithms can detect issues in real time. Maintenance experts no longer need to be
                     near maintenance activities; they can even be in a different country, creating new flows of
                     services and data.

                     Telemedicine and remote surgery will become more viable as 5G networks transmit sharp
                     images without any delays and robots become more highly responsive to precise remote
                     manipulation. Verizon’s precommercial 5G has been tested for use in telemedicine through
                     a pilot by Columbia University. With a 5G connection and headsets, therapists conducted
                     physical motor rehabilitation with patients in remote locations.

                     NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL HAVE A MIXED IMPACT ON TRADE FLOWS AND
                     ARE LIKELY TO ACCELERATE THE SHIFT FROM GOODS TO SERVICE FLOWS
                     We size the potential impact on flows created by six next-generation technologies: digital
                     platforms, logistics technologies, additive manufacturing, automation technologies
                     (advanced robotics and AI), electric vehicles, and renewable resources (Exhibit 31). We do
                     not size every new technology on the horizon, nor do we undertake general equilibrium
                     modeling that incorporates second- and third-order impacts on prices, productivity, and
                     demand. But this exercise does illustrate the degree to which technologies could affect
                     trade flows. Some of these effects are already unfolding, while others will likely occur in the
                     next five to ten years. Some other technologies discussed above (such as autonomous
                     vehicles and 5G) could be tremendously important, but we excluded them due to greater
                     uncertainty surrounding the timing and scope of their adoption. See the technical appendix
                     for details on our methodology.

                                  Technologies that reduce transaction costs could increase trade
                                   Cross-border e-commerce. This already-huge market has great potential for
                                     continued growth. Forecasts vary significantly by country, based on their current
                                     maturity. In the United States, for example, growth has been strong since the early 2000s
                                     but is now slowing. Countries such as India have a great deal of room for future growth.

                                        In the aggregate, we estimate that e-commerce could boost goods trade by $1.3 trillion
                                        to $2.1 trillion (4 to 6 percent) by 2030.132 One caveat is that the recent US withdrawal
                                        from the Universal Postal Union agreement, which set low international shipping rates for
                                        small orders from China to the United States, may affect trade flows.

                                        Some e-commerce purchases from foreign sellers may simply substitute for traditional trade flows that
                                        would have taken place in offline channels. To avoid double counting because of this effect, we use a range
                                        of assumptions on what we believe will be incremental trade created as e-commerce platforms give people
                                        access to goods that were not previously available and stimulate additional demand.

                      Logistics technologies. Based on evidence to date, we conservatively assume that
                        the IoT and other forms of digitization such as blockchain could improve shipment and
                        logistics times for traded goods by 10 to 20 percent. We also make a conservative
                        estimate that 20 percent of ports could be automated by 2030, reducing global
                        processing times for shipments of goods by 6 to 8 percent.

                           Combining these technologies, we see potential to improve transit times for traded
                           goods by 16 to 28 percent by 2030. Using trade elasticities found in the literature, we
                           assume a 0.4 percent increase in trade flows for every 1 percent reduction in processing
                           times.133 Looking at each country’s average processing time today and its bilateral flows
                           of both exports and imports, we see that Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia—all of which
                           have lengthy and cumbersome logistics and customs procedures—are among the
                           countries that could make the biggest gains.

                     Altogether, we calculate that these technologies could boost trade in manufactured goods
                     and agriculture by $1.5 trillion to $2.6 trillion annually by 2030, an increase of 6 to 10 percent.

                     Technologies that alter the economics of production could reduce trade, with
                     some exceptions
                      Advanced robotics and AI. Overall, these technologies in manufacturing could
                        enable more production near key markets as labor costs become less important in
                        location decisions.

                           We derive each country’s adoption potential by 2030 using a model developed for MGI’s
                           previous research on automation.134 To assess the potential disruption to trade flows, we
                           look specifically at exports from developing countries to developed countries, as well as
                           exports from developing countries to China. We model a scenario in which companies
                           in advanced markets that automate a significant proportion of their processes decide to
                           reshore production or refrain from offshoring future production.

                           Using these assumptions, automation could reduce goods trade by up to $3.0 trillion
                           annually by 2030, a 5 to 10 percent decrease (Exhibit 32). The largest shares of
                           affected trade flows are likely to be in value chains that produce labor-intensive goods.
                           A significant share of production in regional processing and resource-intensive goods
                           value chains could also be automated, but these goods are already less traded. While
                           automation could disrupt trade flows, it is worth noting two countervailing factors. First,
                           developing countries can use automation to become more competitive and develop
                           new specializations. Second, as advanced economies automate, their higher output will
                           require more inputs, some of which may be imported.

                           In addition, we find that AI, virtual agents, and robotic process automation could reduce
                           trade in business and IT services by $130 billion to $270 billion annually by 2030, or 5 to
                           9 percent. The impact is likely to be much higher in the BPO subset of these services,
                           given the high tradability and repetitive nature of BPO work and the fact that companies
                           in advanced economies could turn to AI tools rather than offshoring those services.

                                     Additive manufacturing. We consider specific product categories and estimate
                                       the share of printable parts in each, based on technical feasibility and interviews with
                                       experts. This share ranges widely across products, from 20 percent in aircraft to
                                       70 percent in toys. We then consider the economic viability of 3-D printing for each
                                       product category.

                                        We estimate that additive manufacturing could reduce goods trade by only 1 to
                                        2 percent (or some $350 billion to $790 billion annually) by 2030. The largest potential
                                        impact on trade in dollar terms is in vehicle and aircraft parts, while the highest share of
                                        impact is in footwear and toys (Exhibit 33). As noted above, additive manufacturing can
                                        increase trade in certain product categories, but it is not competitive for mass production
                                        in most industries today.

                               New goods and services, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy, could
                               reduce trade flows
                                Electric vehicles. As EVs become a bigger share of the automotive market, they will
                                  likely reduce trade in both oil and vehicle parts. By 2030, the oil trade could potentially
                                  fall by $39 billion to $69 billion annually, for a drop of 3 to 6 percent in traded crude
                                  and refined petroleum. This estimate is based on both expected oil consumption and
                                  expected penetration of EVs by 2030.

                                     Trade in vehicle engines and parts will likely decline as EVs gain market share, since they
                                     have fewer moving parts than vehicles with internal combustion engines. We identified
                                     which car parts are not required in EVs and estimate that they account for approximately
                                     35 percent of the total value of trade in parts. To determine the impact on trade, we
                                     consider market projections for EV sales in each country by 2030. All told, we estimate
                                     that EVs could reduce the $1.4 trillion trade in vehicle parts by $86 billion to $140 billion,
                                     or 6 to 10 percent, by 2030.

                                Renewable energy. The switch to less traded solar photovoltaic and wind power for
                                  electricity generation could dampen the commodities trade. Renewables will likely
                                  produce minimal trade flows, since solar and wind power are typically harnessed
                                  in the same country where they are generated. In total, we estimate that imports of
                                  commodities for energy production could decline by 23 percent relative to the base
                                  case by 2030, for a drop of $78 billion. Imports of related equipment could decline by
                                  20 percent relative to the base case, a $26 billion decrease. Together this produces a
                                  $104 billion decline in annual trade by 2030.

                                                                                      •••

                               The continuing march of technology is reshaping individual industries as well as the
                               comparative advantages of nations. It underscores the rising importance of traded
                               services, knowledge flows, and skills. The chapters that follow examine how companies are
                               competing in this new landscape and the implications for policy makers and workers.

5. HOW COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING
TO VALUE CHAIN DISRUPTION
The previous chapters paint a picture of global value chains in transition, and these
changes hold significant implications for where and how companies compete. The rising
importance of knowledge and intangibles, for example, raises the stakes for cultivating
digital capabilities and workforce skills. Many companies are altering their operating
models as services offer new sources of value across industries. Automation reduces the
value of labor-cost arbitrage and enables placing production closer to customers. The
changing map of global demand may require setting up new regional supply chains. Tighter
coordination with supplier networks is becoming necessary—not only to reduce production
cycle times but also to capture the full potential of new technologies in production and
logistics. On top of these structural shifts, global companies must now contend with new
and rising risks, not least of which are tariffs and other trade barriers (see Box 5, “How
companies are responding to rising trade tensions”).

All of this adds up to a more challenging landscape—and one in which competitors are
coming from all sides. Global companies must reassess periodically whether they are
competing in the right part of the value chain and whether they have the organizational
structure to operate effectively across borders. Speed to market and seamless coordination
across supplier ecosystems are growing imperatives. In this chapter, we explore five
imperatives for companies to adapt to these changes.

NEW ENTRANTS ARE DISRUPTING VALUE CHAINS, CREATING NEW WINNERS
AND LOSERS
In industry after industry, new entrants are shifting the competitive dynamics, introducing
radically different business models, and turning up the pressure on incumbents.

Tech companies are disrupting value chains
New entrants are striking in faster and more unpredictable ways than ever before. In some
cases, they have not only scaled up and rapidly gained market share in a particular niche;
they have also integrated vertically and pushed beyond traditional sector boundaries. This
is not just a Silicon Valley phenomenon. In China, the digital ecosystem, once led by a few
giants, is rapidly expanding. One-third of the world’s “unicorns” (privately held startups
valued at over $1 billion) are now based in China.135

New tech disrupters are expanding up and down the value chain. Netflix, for example, has
moved from acquiring licensing and distribution rights to existing movies and TV shows to
producing its own content. Venturing upstream gave Netflix differentiation and momentum
for its rapid international scale-up. More than half of its approximately 118 million subscribers
are located outside of the United States, and they contribute slightly over 45 percent of the
company’s revenues.136 Netflix now has titles in more than 20 viewing languages and is
filming original content in languages other than English. Amazon is integrating downstream
into distribution by building out its own fleets of cargo planes, delivery trucks, and delivery
drones. The company has even begun to act as a freight operator, arranging ocean
shipments to the United States for Chinese vendors. In 2018, Amazon announced a new
delivery service to pick up merchandise from small retailers and move it to the company’s
own fulfillment centers. These moves pose a new competitive challenge to incumbents in

                     the shipping and logistics industry.137 Ocado, a UK-based online-only grocer known for
                     its distinctive logistics solutions, has moved into licensing its proprietary hardware and
                     software to retailers around the world.

                     New competition is coming from the developing world
                     While the previous wave of globalization was characterized by Western multinationals
                     entering developing economies, the next phase is seeing a wave move in the opposite
                     direction. Companies headquartered in the developing world are expanding into new
                     markets worldwide—and in some cases, they are challenging Western incumbents in their
                     own backyards. They now have the scale and know-how to take on incumbents that may
                     have held comfortable market positions for decades. Chinese, Indian, and other emerging-
                     market companies are increasingly using M&A strategies to expand into global markets.138
                     China’s outbound M&A flows soared from $49 billion in 2010 to $227 billion in 2016, when
                     they were six times higher than the amount foreign companies spent on acquiring Chinese
                     firms.139

                     Box 5. How companies are responding to rising trade tensions
                     From Brexit to the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, companies
                     that operate across borders face a new level of uncertainty. Policy shifts may demand agile
                     responses. Volvo, now owned by Chinese company Geely, is changing planned exports
                     across its global operations; part of the adjustment involves canceling plans to sell sedans
                     made in South Carolina to China.1 BMW has similarly halted exports from South Carolina to
                     China and is considering producing more vehicles in China as a result.2 Companies that can
                     alter production and export flows rapidly will be able to respond dynamically to policy moves
                     that affect their bottom line. Columbia Sportswear, for example, pairs designers with trade
                     experts to adjust clothing content as needed to avoid tariffs.3

                     The September 2018 McKinsey Global Executive Survey on economic sentiment included
                     questions about trade and globalization.4 Thirty-three percent of respondents said that
                     uncertainty over trade policy is their top concern, while another 25 percent specifically
                     pointed to recent tariff increases (Exhibit 34). Many expect these pressures to affect their
                     financial performance. If current tariffs persist and escalate, 46 percent of respondents
                     expect lower revenue growth, 36 percent expect to reduce head count in regional offices
                     and foreign affiliates, and 30 percent foresee reduced head count in their headquarters.

                     Three-quarters of companies say they are adjusting their strategies, although only one-
                     quarter are taking “moderate” or “significant” action immediately. Nearly half of respondents
                     state that their companies will build out operations in one or more key countries in response
                     to new trade policies. Meanwhile, 24 percent of companies expect to step up investment in
                     local supply chains in response to tariffs, potentially reversing years of global fragmentation.

                                 SMEs have new opportunities to participate directly in globalization
                                 While giant multinational corporations have long dominated trade in goods and services, the
                                 internet can be a great equalizer. Today’s more digital form of globalization opens the door
                                 for businesses of any size to participate—and even go head-to-head with bigger players.

                                 Many small and medium-size companies have joined e-commerce marketplaces where
                                 they can gain direct exposure to global customers. Amazon hosts two million third-party
                                 sellers, and Alibaba hosts more than ten million. Some 80 million small and medium-size
                                 enterprises use Facebook for marketing, and nearly 40 percent of their fans are foreign.
                                 Lazada, a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, offers a marketplace where
                                 sellers can hire service providers for functions such as graphic design and accounting.

                                 Beyond the ability to use platforms, enterprise software and cheap computing power on the
                                 cloud have changed the economics of working with collaborators, suppliers, and customers
                                 in different countries. Furthermore, some digital players have sprung up to help serve the
                                 needs of “micromultinationals.” Shippo, for instance, helps online businesses streamline
                                 shipping. It makes multiple service providers available and even automates the process of
                                 filling out customs forms. Zendesk offers a package of tools and services to help small
                                 businesses manage customer service. Based in the United States, it serves businesses in
                                 60 geographies.

                     GLOBAL COMPANIES NEED TO REASSESS WHERE THEY OPERATE ALONG
                     THE VALUE CHAIN
                     A real profitability premium is associated with globalization. Recent MGI analysis of the
                     5,750 largest firms by revenue found that the best-performing “superstar” firms have a
                     foreign-to-domestic sales ratio nearly twice as high as that of median firms in the sample.140
                     Furthermore, a large body of research shows that globalized companies tend to be
                     significantly more productive. This may be because of self-selection (that is, the most
                     productive firms choose to become exporters) or because exposure to trade, investment,
                     and foreign competition helps firms gain know-how and become more productive.141

                     But capturing global opportunities is not easy. While there is no one-size-fits-all formula for
                     every industry and market, we do see companies sharpening their strategies and homing
                     in more directly on different parts of the value chain. The models below, while not mutually
                     exclusive, offer a framework for viewing these challenges (Exhibit 35).142

                     Global offerings
                     Companies with global offerings minimize complexity by selling standardized products
                     across multiple markets. Although distinct local capabilities are still needed for distribution
                     and sales, and manufacturing can be done globally, they concentrate their design functions
                     in headquarters or regional hubs. This model is often seen in the aerospace, electronics,
                     and steel industries. But it is difficult to maintain profitability with this approach in industries
                     where value is shifting, as in automotive (which is becoming more R&D-intensive) or even
                     food and beverage (where the trend is toward customizing for local tastes).

                     Sticking with the global offerings strategy requires doubling down on core competencies
                     and efficiency to realize economies of scale, applying time-tested “continuous
                     improvement” models such as lean operations or Six Sigma. Many companies with global
                     offerings are focused on agile manufacturing, with highly integrated, digitally enabled
                     production systems. In these operations, factory floors become information networks
                     that harness data to make instant, autonomous adjustments. The goals are minimizing
                     energy consumption, rework, and waste while maximizing output and quality. Productivity,
                     responsiveness, and smoother collaboration with suppliers are the core goals. The Tata
                     Group’s Tata Steel, for example, is prioritizing automation and other technologies to be as
                     labor- and energy-efficient as possible.

94   McKinsey Global Institute          5. How companies are responding to value chain disruption


                            Researcher
                            The rising importance of innovation and intangibles has caused some companies to pursue
                            a strategy squarely focused on those types of assets. Companies in the researcher model
                            tend to centralize decision making and R&D in headquarters or regional hubs and outsource
                            production processes, whether through franchising or contract manufacturing—and this
                            unbundling creates opportunities for other suppliers to step into the value chain with their
                            own specialized capabilities. For these companies, it is now possible to achieve higher gains
                            from innovation than from manufacturing excellence, so they structure their organizations
                            around the backbone functions they see as the real drivers of value. Global pharmaceutical
                            giants are among the companies pursuing this strategy. Some turn to contract development
                            and manufacturing organizations (such as Wuxi AppTec in China and Intas Pharmaceuticals
                            in India) to handle their clinical trials and the physical production of drugs. These CDMOs
                            provide lower costs but also specialized expertise; they are typically important strategic
                            partners for pharmaceutical firms.

                            While it is no surprise to see this kind of strategy in a scientific field such as pharmaceuticals
                            or an engineering field such as software, the researcher model is also prevalent in consumer
                            goods industries. It may seem strange to associate an everyday product such as athletic
                            shoes, for example, with research, but a company such as Nike is highly focused on design
                            and marketing in its corporate operations and reliant on international contract manufacturing
                            for the actual production of its shoes. In fact, the Nike Explore Team Sport Research Lab at
                            the company’s Oregon headquarters is a research facility staffed with dozens of scientists
                            who study and test athletic performance to inform product development.143

                            Customizer
                            The shift in global demand toward developing countries means that companies must
                            take a wider variety of local consumer tastes into account. A contrasting alternative to
                            the researcher model involves focusing downstream on expanding and customizing
                            product portfolios to fit the profusion of local tastes. This strategy leads companies to a
                            decentralized, hyperlocal structure. As companies sell in multiple markets, it takes careful
                            analytical research to understand which products and services will resonate and how to
                            market them in a way that will suit the local context.144 The key for companies is striking
                            the right balance between staying in tune with local customers and realizing economies
                            of scale.

                            Customizer strategies are most often seen among food and beverage, apparel, and retail
                            companies. Swiss food giant Nestlé, for example, tapped into a huge vein of demand in
                            Japan for its Kit Kat candy bars, offered in hundreds of unique flavors such as wasabi,
                            azuki bean, and green tea. New digital supply chain technologies have made it possible to
                            manage this proliferation of products. Now technology is enabling companies to experiment
                            with customizing not only for different regional markets but for individual customers. Levi’s,
                            for instance, has developed a digital prototyping and automated finishing process that
                            allows customers to order jeans with custom fits and finishes.

                            Two of the world’s most iconic brands—Coke and Pepsi—illustrate how companies are
                            mixing and matching strategies. Both have clear, recognizable global offerings that remain
                            flagship products, yet both have increased their local focus in recent years to win market
                            share in diverse new markets.

                     The flagship Coca-Cola beverage, which is distributed in every country on earth except
                     Cuba and North Korea, is no longer a monolithic product; its formulation varies across
                     geographies, using different types and degrees of sweetening to accommodate local tastes.
                     In addition, Coca-Cola owns many brands with only local or regional distribution, including
                     Thumbs Up in India, Georgia Coffee in Japan, and both Costa Coffee and Innocent juices
                     in the United Kingdom. The company maximizes the potential of these local brands through
                     its “lift and shift” strategy: when a product is successful in one part of the world, Coca-Cola
                     “lifts” it and “shifts” it to another market.145

                     Similarly, PepsiCo’s corporate structure consists of six global divisions so that the firm can
                     focus strategy by region. One of the company’s flagship brands is Lay’s Potato Chips, which
                     has been introduced to markets worldwide—and then tailored with a huge variety of flavors
                     that appeal to local palates. These include hot chili squid in Thailand, blueberry in China,
                     “magic masala” in India, feta cheese in Greece, and ketchup in Canada. Like Coca-Cola,
                     PepsiCo has either acquired or developed local brands in markets around the world.

                     Global-local services
                     As services assume a greater role in trade and economic growth, some multinational
                     companies are pursuing a global-local services strategy. These companies have recognized
                     global brands but also extensive local operations that they use to deliver in-person services.

                     The classic example of this model is the fast-food franchise model pioneered by McDonald’s
                     and followed by many other fast-food and fast-casual restaurants chains. Today McDonald’s
                     has some 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries worldwide—with more locations
                     outside the United States than within it. Its model is based on providing a familiar experience
                     anywhere in the world (although some menu items are added or subtracted in different
                     countries to appeal to local tastes). To deliver consistency, McDonald’s has strict franchise
                     agreements, approved suppliers, and an institutional training program for franchisees.
                     Similarly, Starbucks may vary its product offerings by market, but its brand and in-person
                     customer experience are highly recognizable and standardized across its more than 28,000
                     stores in 75 countries. These intangibles were developed at headquarters.

                     This model has more recently been adopted by some digital platform companies. These
                     firms use efficiencies of scale to expand their recognizable brands worldwide, providing
                     one global platform that matches buyers and sellers. But at the same time, their value
                     proposition is a highly local and personal customer touchpoint. With more than five
                     million properties in more than 190 countries, Airbnb, for example, provides the platform
                     architecture and payment systems so that users can browse and book accommodations. Its
                     guidelines, standards, and reviews create the trust needed to underpin these transactions,
                     but a loose network of hosts provides the actual accommodations and the hospitality. Uber
                     similarly provides a global platform for a highly local service in more than 600 cities.

96   McKinsey Global Institute         5. How companies are responding to value chain disruption


                            Platform
                            Some of the world’s biggest companies operate technology-enabled marketplaces
                            that either facilitate exchanges between counterparties (for example, Amazon, Alibaba,
                            and Flipkart) or provide tailored offerings to large captive customer bases (for example,
                            Tencent Video and Spotify). While the term “platform company” is often discussed, it is
                            not well defined. Digital platforms can play several functions in facilitating transactions:
                            search, coordination, payment, and product delivery. Companies can play in one or more
                            of the parts in a platform value chain. E-commerce platform providers, for instance, play
                            all functions. PayPal strictly facilitates payments. Other platforms, such as Facebook and
                            Baidu, enable customers to search for sellers and may even coordinate transactions, but
                            they do not collect payments or deliver goods. For all platform companies, a capital-light
                            business model enables them to scale up rapidly—and because of increasing returns to
                            scale, only a few companies will succeed globally in each product or service market. Their
                            operations remain highly centralized.

                            The biggest hyperscale platforms host billions of users and interactions. Delivering an
                            additional song through iTunes or welcoming a new user to a social network results in
                            effectively no cost for Apple or Facebook, respectively, whether it is the tenth unit or the ten
                            billionth. This kind of scale gives platform operators a prime position to capture troves of
                            valuable behavioral data that they can monetize, employ to make continuous improvements
                            to the ecosystem, or even use to add new business lines (as with Amazon’s move into cloud
                            computing, Apple’s move into digital payments, or Alibaba’s move into financial services).146

                            While the biggest consumer-facing social media, entertainment, and e-commerce sites
                            are well known, some platform companies are focusing on the B2B space. These include
                            Xometry, a US-based marketplace for on-demand manufacturing capacity, and EC21, a
                            South Korean B2B e-commerce platform for small and medium-size exporting firms.

                            Networker
                            Networked companies, most of which are service providers, have multiple decentralized
                            and geographically dispersed operational nodes. Examples include financial services,
                            business and professional service providers, telecom companies, and transportation
                            companies. Their sales, operations, and supply chains are often local, exclusively serving
                            one node, but value is created through their global reach and expertise.

                            This approach is often taken in banking, IT services, and business services—industries
                            where knowledge flows, customized to serve client needs, are the heart of the offering
                            and the competitive advantage. HSBC, for example, is a wholesale and retail bank with
                            its core markets in Hong Kong (where it originated) and the United Kingdom (its official
                            headquarters). But it has a presence in almost 70 geographies globally, including major
                            trade hubs, with an extensive footprint in Asia. Business consulting is also built around the
                            networker strategy. Many firms maintain offices in cities worldwide. The business model
                            involves assembling the right combination of expertise from across a widely dispersed
                            organization and continuously forming teams for client engagements. This is made
                            possible not only through travel and face-to-face work but also through a wide variety of
                            communications and collaboration tools.

                            FIVE IMPERATIVES FOR OPERATING IN THE NEW ERA OF GLOBALIZATION
                            In addition to deciding where to play along the value chain, companies must also reassess
                            their own global operations. This includes looking at where to locate operations, prioritizing
                            proximity to customers and speed to market, building flexibility and resiliency to manage
                            rising uncertainty, developing closer supply chain relationships, and considering how
                            services can add new sources of value.

                            Reconsider operational footprint to reflect new risks
                            One of the most important considerations is where to locate operations and invest in new
                            capacity. The calculus that held in the past is different today. New automation technologies,
                            an expanding set of risks, changing wage differentials, and the increasing importance of
                            speed to market in some industries are all driving regionalization in many goods-producing
                            value chains. As a result, it may make sense to place production in or near key consumer
                            markets around the world.147 Before investing, companies must consider the full risk-
                            adjusted, end-to-end landed costs of location decisions. Today many do not account for all
                            of the variables (including the potential backlash and societal costs of offshoring). Using a
                            dynamic, risk-adjusted scenario approach, rather than a simple point forecast of demand or
                            cost, can inform better decisions about defining an operational footprint.

                            Build flexible, agile operations to cope with uncertainty
                            Companies have long created future risk scenarios, but today they face a more complex
                            set of unknowns than ever before as the postwar world order that held for decades seems
                            to be giving way. There is a real chance that tariffs and nontariff barriers will continue
                            rise, reversing decades of trade liberalization. Tax codes are being reconsidered for the
                            digital and intangible era, and the US tax reforms of December 2017 will have important
                            implications for location decisions, including those governing intangible assets. In light
                            of these uncertainties, building flexibility and resiliency into operations and strategy
                            is imperative.148

                            This can take many forms across the value chain. Some manufacturers use platforms to
                            share components across product lines and multiple plants. Toyota, for example, is rolling
                            out a versatile manufacturing platform with more common parts across various models.
                            The company recently invested $1.3 billion to upgrade its factory in Georgetown, Kentucky,
                            improving the plant’s ability to accommodate different body styles and power trains
                            seamlessly. Toyota is introducing this new manufacturing system in its plants worldwide.149
                            In the purchasing process, flexibility can come from strategies such as price hedging, long-
                            term contracting, shaping customer demand to enable using substitutes, and integrating
                            upstream supply chains.

                            Prioritize speed to market and proximity to customers
                            Staying in sync with customers and maintaining the ability to deliver to them quickly is an
                            increasingly important point of competition for companies serving retail consumers. In
                            some markets, excellence in marketing, distribution, sales, and consumer insights may be
                            enough, but a growing number of companies are now establishing production in or near key
                            consumer markets around the world for better delivery and responsiveness.

                      Speed to market enables faster responses to customer preferences and less product
                      waste from forecasting errors. In apparel, the fast-fashion industry is predicated on spotting
                      trends, capitalizing on them immediately, and getting new styles into stores in a matter of
                      weeks. Zara is able to deliver products in two to five weeks by keeping its sourcing within
                      geographic proximity of the retail market and relying on quick manufacturing turnarounds.150
                      Even traditional labels are trying to cut lead times before introducing new seasonal offerings
                      so they can get a better read on sales figures from the current season and tweak their
                      lineups accordingly, reducing unsold goods. Companies in all industries now have a wealth
                      of real-time, granular sales and consumer behavior data at their disposal, but capitalizing on
                      these insights requires speed in manufacturing.

                      Serving customers with maximum responsiveness and optimal speed does not necessarily
                      involve large-scale reshoring or full vertical integration in every major market. Companies
                      can opt for postponement—that is, creating a largely standardized product at a distance
                      and then finishing it with custom touches at a facility near the end market. The final step
                      can vary from simple labeling changes to more significant product tailoring. Mastering
                      postponement technologies and techniques enables companies to take advantage of
                      distant, cost-efficient manufacturing while also allowing for late-stage customization for
                      either government compliance or customer personalization.

                      Offer everything as a service
                      Across value chains, more value is coming from services, whether in software, design,
                      and intellectual property or in distribution, marketing, and after-sales services. Even
                      manufacturers are increasingly finding value in service offerings. Shifting to services can
                      offer advantages: smoothing cyclicality in sales, providing higher-margin revenue streams,
                      and enabling new sales or design ideas through closer interaction with customers. At
                      its extreme, entire business models shift from producing goods to delivering services
                      (for example, from selling vehicles to offering transportation services, or from selling
                      software packages to renting cloud storage and services). Services can be far more
                      varied than traditional maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. They can maximize
                      product utilization (for example, reducing downtime and outages for transformers in utility
                      grids), minimize the total cost of ownership (improving the operational efficiency of aircraft
                      engines), or optimize how a product works (by capturing data from medical devices for
                      better diagnoses). For service models to succeed, companies often need to make large
                      commitments to understanding the customer’s needs, invest in data and analytics, and
                      develop the right subscription, per-use, or performance-based service contracts.

                      Build closer supplier relationships
                      In the last era of globalization, the fragmentation of value chains and the trend toward
                      offshoring led many companies into dozens, if not hundreds, of arm’s-length relationships
                      with suppliers scattered across the globe. But these involved many hidden risks and costs.
                      In many industries, companies are realizing that arm’s-length supplier interactions are often
                      inefficient—and this can add real development, tooling, and product costs. Even firms that
                      work closely with their tier-one suppliers may have little visibility into their tier-two and -three
                      suppliers, especially if they are overseas.

                      Logistics and production technologies can transform supply chains, but optimizing what
                      they can do requires end-to-end integration. Larger companies may need to help their
                      small and medium-size suppliers upgrade and add digital capabilities to realize their full
                      value. Large firms can benefit from a thorough analysis of which suppliers are core to the
                      business—and may learn that these are not always the largest accounts. Some may involve

                            critical components deep in the supply chain.151 Once these key suppliers are identified,
                            companies can solicit their ideas and build a deeper relationship based on trust.

                            Firms at the head of a global value chain that genuinely collaborate ensure that they remain
                            the preferred customer and are the first to benefit from new product ideas or process
                            efficiencies bubbling up from suppliers. They can also enable systemic changes along the
                            value chain, improving labor and environmental standards.152

                            Few firms have managed to digitize the entire value chain, creating a single digital
                            thread that provides transparency and control from prototyping and design through
                            production, distribution, and sales.153 But building closer relationships can accelerate this
                            transformation—especially in cases where smaller suppliers need help with the investment
                            or capability building needed to make the leap.154

                                                                                     •••

                            In the last wave of globalization, many companies developed sprawling global footprints
                            that spanned different parts of the value chain. But as those footprints grew, they also grew
                            unwieldy. Faced with increasing competition, many firms are sharpening their organizational
                            structures and strategies, in some cases opting to localize and consolidate production.

                                  The typical consumer company’s supply chain accounts for more than 80 percent of greenhouse-gas
                                  emissions and more than 90 percent of the impact on air, land, water, biodiversity, and geological resources.
                                  More global companies are now working closely with suppliers to address this challenge.

6. THE ROAD AHEAD FOR COUNTRIES
AND WORKERS
Globalization is not an immutable or monolithic trend. It is shaped by multilateral and bilateral
trade agreements, national policies, technology, changing global demand, and decisions
made by millions of individual companies and consumers.

The previous wave of globalization, combined with unprecedented urbanization, fed into a
virtuous cycle of growth that lifted hundreds of millions of people in developing countries
out of poverty. But it was also intertwined with a range of issues in those regions, including
environmental degradation and poor working conditions. Meanwhile, many low- and
medium-skill workers in advanced economies were left behind (even as those same
countries benefited from lower prices on consumer goods).

As we publish this report in January 2019, the world is facing uncertainty. The United
Kingdom has not finalized the terms surrounding its exit from the European Union, and
the United States and China are exchanging rounds of retaliatory tariffs. Anti-globalization
sentiment has been percolating through political movements worldwide. In countries
around the world, the backlash is forcing a belated acknowledgement that globalization
produces winners and losers—and its dislocations and negative externalities have not been
adequately addressed.

Yet globalization is not what it was even a decade ago. As we have documented, global
value chains are being reshaped by rising demand and new industry capabilities in the
developing world as well as a wave of new technologies. Labor-cost arbitrage is on the
wane in most value chains, while services, intangibles, and knowledge intensity are on the
rise. These shifts may favor some advanced economies, while posing steeper challenges
for countries that did not participate fully in the last wave of value chain expansion. Policy
agendas shaped by old assumptions may not be effective in the next phase of globalization,
which demands more attention to digital infrastructure, service capabilities, and
workforce skills.

Countries of all income levels may alter their specializations and global partnerships in the
years to come. But this calls for more than simply adding up a ledger of export surpluses
and trade deficits. Countries reap economic gains from all aspects of their give and take
with the rest of the world. The nature of globalization is changing, but one thing remains
constant: the countries that open themselves to foreign competition, foreign investment,
and foreign talent stand to benefit most. Previous MGI research has found that participation
in global flows—both outflows and inflows—accounted for 15 to 25 percent of GDP growth
between 1997 and 2012.155 Countries that are more open to all types of cross-border flows
can absorb the best ideas and innovations from around the world. Moreover, our work found
that countries that are more central in networks of global flows gain even more than those
that have fewer and less diverse connections in the global economy.

                                       COUNTRIES PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES IN GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS
                                       There are as many ways to participate in globalization as there are nations on earth. Each
                                       country’s profile is different, with its weight and role varying across industry value chains. Yet
                                       some general patterns emerge that can illuminate how current and future shifts will affect
                                       countries and workers. To highlight them, we group countries into categories based on
                                       their income level, their connectedness to the global economy, their specialization, and the
                                       diversity of their trade (Exhibit 36).

McKinsey Global Institute            Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains                                                          105


                      We first divide countries into two groups: advanced and developing. Advanced economies
                      tend to specialize in activities that demand a higher level of skills, such as producing global
                      innovations or services, while developing countries tend to focus on resource- or labor-
                      intensive activities.156

                      To measure each country’s level of connectedness to the global economy, we update the
                      MGI Connectedness Index, developed in our previous research on globalization. It is based
                      on the size of each country’s inflows and outflows of goods, services, finance, people, and
                      data.157 To assess each country’s specialization in value chains, we measure the global
                      value chain archetype in which it runs the largest trade surplus.158 While countries participate
                      in multiple global value chains, the groupings shown here nevertheless offer a useful way
                      to assess their exposure to the structural shifts that are unfolding. Finally, we look at each
                      country’s trade intensity and the diversification of its exports (represented as the number of
                      sectors required to reach 75 percent of its gross exports).

                      Using these metrics, we identify four groups of advanced economies: service providers,
                      global innovators, regional processors, and resource providers. Developing countries are
                      split into five categories. Innovation providers are major trading partners and suppliers
                      for companies in nearby advanced economies that produce global innovations such as
                      automobiles. Labor providers specialize in labor-intensive manufacturing—and that is still
                      where China runs its largest trade surplus today, although it is making a singular, rapid rise
                      across multiple value chains. Other developing countries specialize in regional processing,
                      natural resources, or services.

                      Below we discuss the specific challenges and opportunities facing each of these groups.
                      Yet a few priorities apply more generally. No matter where countries specialize today,
                      developing service sectors and capabilities is an important opportunity for the future.
                      Investment in R&D will be critical to competing in an increasingly knowledge-intensive global
                      economy. All countries—and particularly those that are major producers of labor-intensive
                      goods—need to prepare for the wider adoption of automation technologies. A great deal of
                      potential remains to be realized in deepening regional trade ties in many parts of the world.
                      Finally, every country can benefit from streamlining customs operations and modernizing
                      trade agreements.

                            It is worth noting that many countries run surpluses across several value chains and almost all countries
                            participate across all value chains, so while we have classified each country into a single group, the
                            implications are likely to be relevant to different extents across archetypes.

                                 SHIFTS IN GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS COULD FAVOR ADVANCED ECONOMIES
                                 As value chains expanded into developing economies in recent decades, the resulting
                                 investment and industrialization gave hundreds of millions of their workers new pathways out
                                 of poverty. Advanced economies benefited as well, but their gains were more diffuse. One
                                 study estimates that international trade may have been responsible for about one-quarter
                                 of total US productivity growth over the 1990s and 2000s, and that it provides middle-class
                                 consumers with more than a quarter of their purchasing power.159

                                 But one group conspicuously lost out: low- and medium-skill workers in advanced
                                 economies.160 Manufacturing employment has declined substantially in most of these
                                 countries (Exhibit 37). While the relative importance of automation and trade in explaining
                                 this decline is debated, millions of individuals lost their livelihoods in the transition (see Box 6,
                                 “The impact of trade on employment and wages in advanced economies”).

                    Box 6. The impact of trade on employment and wages in advanced economies
                    The decline of manufacturing in advanced economies hit particularly hard in smaller cities and
                    towns that lacked diversified economies. When major employers closed down, some local
                    economies collapsed.1 Debate continues about whether trade or the first wave of automation
                    technologies played the biggest role in this phenomenon—but foreign competition was a
                    prime target for blame in many of those communities.

                    Academic research has found that between 1990 and 2007, US manufacturing subsectors
                    and communities that were more exposed to increased import competition from China
                    experienced substantially larger reductions in manufacturing employment. These trade
                    shocks were not fully offset by a rise in employment elsewhere in the community, and
                    employment declined for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, suggesting
                    negative spillover effects from reduced demand to other parts of the local economy.2 Contrary
                    to the common presumption that US labor markets are highly fluid, these authors also find
                    that displaced manufacturing workers did not smoothly transition to new employment. These
                    shocks persisted for at least a decade. Job losses remained concentrated; they coincided
                    with a long-term decline in geographic mobility in the United States.

                    Another study estimates that import growth from China between 1999 and 2011 led to
                    the loss of 2.0 million to 2.4 million US jobs, including workers directly affected by import
                    competition, workers indirectly affected through the supply chain, and workers in other
                    sectors. This compares to total US manufacturing job losses of 5.8 million over that period.3

                    Similar patterns have been documented in a range of countries, including Spain, Norway,
                    and Brazil. Yet the story played out differently in Germany. In contrast to findings from the
                    United States, German manufacturers sharply increased exports to both China and Eastern
                    Europe, resulting in a more modest trade deficit with China and a trade surplus with Eastern
                    Europe. Employment gains from these export opportunities roughly offset job losses from
                    import competition from China; in the case of trade with Eastern Europe, they increased
                    German employment.4

                    Trade has also affected wages. The studies referenced above find that local labor markets
                    that were more exposed to import competition experienced larger reductions in average
                    weekly wages; these effects hit low-wage workers the hardest. The reduction in wages
                    was not limited to manufacturing but was also felt outside that sector in local communities.
                    Workers exposed to trade also experienced greater job churn over their careers and spent
                    more years receiving Social Security Disability Insurance.5 The evidence suggests wages in
                    other advanced countries were similarly depressed by trade.6

                    The rise and fall of individual companies and sectors has always accompanied the ongoing
                    reallocation of resources across economies. While it ultimately raises overall productivity and
                    living standards, the process creates winners, losers, and pain along the way. In theory, the
                    overall gains from globalization exceed its costs, allowing the net benefits to be redistributed
                    to compensate the losers. But in practice, this has not yet happened.

108   McKinsey Global Institute       6. The road ahead for countries and workers


                                 Advanced economies that specialize in services and regional processing could
                                 benefit, while global innovators will face rising competition from China
                                 The shifts in global value chains described in this report may work in favor of advanced
                                 economies in the years ahead. Wages are rising in developing countries, and automation
                                 technologies may render labor costs less important as companies decide where to
                                 locate production. Value chains are becoming more knowledge-intensive, which favors
                                 countries with highly skilled workforces, innovation ecosystems, and robust intellectual
                                 property protections. Speed to market is increasingly important, making strong logistics
                                 infrastructure a must. Finally, advanced economies will benefit from the expansion of the
                                 middle class worldwide. Since 1995, their exports of goods and services to developing
                                 economies have grown from $1 trillion to $4.2 trillion.

                                 But while current trends will generally enhance the comparative advantages of advanced
                                 economies, the outlook and priorities vary for individual countries.

                                  Service providers stand to gain. Collectively, advanced economies run a trade surplus
                                    in services of almost $480 billion, twice as high as a decade ago (Exhibit 38). The United
                                    States accounts for half of this. The opportunities are expanding. Over the past decade,
                                    trade in IT services, professional services, and IP charges have grown two to three times
                                    faster than trade in goods. Services are playing a bigger role in goods-producing value
                                    chains, and the range of services that can be delivered digitally and remotely continues
                                    to grow, including new areas such as education and healthcare. Countries with a strong
                                    presence in services (such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and
                                    Sweden) are in a good position to capitalize on these trends.

                       Global innovators will face greater competition from China and other developing
                         countries. Advanced economies such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea run large
                         surpluses in value chains that produce global innovations. But they may find a more
                         challenging environment ahead as China expands its capabilities in these industries
                         and grows less reliant on inputs from advanced economies. Its imports of intermediate
                         goods from Germany in global innovations value chains peaked in 2014 at $44 billion; by
                         2017, the figure was $37 billion. South Korea and Japan have also seen their exports of
                         intermediate goods to China in these value chains decline in recent years. In computers
                         and electronics, China has moved upstream and is now manufacturing chips for its
                         handsets. The Made in China 2025 agenda aims to build the nation’s strengths in
                         cutting-edge areas such as 5G, AI, and smart robotics. China is already the world’s
                         largest consumer of industrial robots, ahead of the United States.

                          Of course, the rise of a new competitor means that companies elsewhere need to
                          hone their strategies—not only through operational excellence in manufacturing but
                          by focusing on the upstream and downstream functions where more value is being
                          generated. Areas such as R&D, design, customer insights, and marketing require more
                          highly skilled labor and are disproportionately dominated by multinationals based in
                          advanced economies.

                       Countries that specialize in regional processing may be more insulated from
                         developing-economy competition. Given the lower tradability of regionally processed
                         goods, the advanced economies that specialize in these value chains (such as Spain,
                         Austria, and Finland) will be relatively insulated from the rise of producers in China and
                         other developing countries. Indeed, these countries may offer an interesting template
                         for developing economies. For instance, Spain’s trade surplus in the food and beverage
                         sector has gone from virtually zero a decade ago to $10 billion today. By increasing its
                         specialization in a highly regional sector, Spain is securing its place in value chains that
                         are less susceptible to truly global competition. In contrast, Austria and Finland are
                         losing their position as net suppliers of regionally processed goods. Both of their trade
                         surpluses are driven by the paper and paper products sector, and both are declining.

                       Resource producers, whether high-income or low-income, face a growing
                         imperative to diversify their economies. This is especially relevant for OPEC countries
                         where growth depends on global trends in oil prices; these economies are exposed to
                         boom-and-bust cycles. Some OPEC countries have long-term economic development
                         agendas for reducing dependence on oil exports. The United Arab Emirates, for
                         example, is expanding into areas such as renewable energy, tourism, aviation and ports,
                         and manufacturing. The risks are lower for resource-producing advanced economies
                         with higher diversification, such as Canada and Australia, but even those countries could
                         benefit from continuing to develop the service sectors that are expected to demonstrate
                         steady trade growth.

                      To capture these opportunities, policy makers in advanced economies must
                      refocus national competitiveness and trade agendas
                      Policy makers in advanced economies need to look toward a future in which innovation,
                      intellectual property, specialized skills, and digital technologies are increasing sources
                      of competitive advantage. Yet they also must reckon with the past. The workers and
                      communities that suffered setbacks during the last era of globalization still need help in
                      finding a way forward.

                      Maintaining public and private R&D spending is essential for advanced economies as
                      value chains shift to more knowledge-intensive activities. R&D is the bedrock of new
                      technology formation, innovation, and the production of intangible assets. Yet in the United
                      States, federal R&D spending has fallen from around 1 percent of GDP a decade ago to


110   McKinsey Global Institute     6. The road ahead for countries and workers


                            0.67 percent in 2017 (although private R&D spending has been maintained). While advanced
                            economies dominate the top ranks of the Bloomberg Innovation Index, some (including the
                            United States, Germany, Finland, and Canada) have been slipping. China rose from number
                            21 in the 2017 index to number 19 in the 2018 version.161

                            Another policy priority is setting the rules and standards for the new era of digital
                            globalization. The virtual nature of the internet and the many novel business models it
                            has launched often raced ahead of traditional regulation and policy, and now officials are
                            beginning to grapple with complex issues surrounding the new digital economy. Countries
                            will have to address issues such as market access, censorship, intellectual property
                            protection, privacy standards, and cybersecurity. But it is important to do so in a way that
                            does not balkanize the internet. Today such efforts tend to be fragmented. The EU recently
                            enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, while many nations require companies to
                            store locally generated data on servers physically located within their borders. A 2 percent
                            sales tax on the locally generated revenues of global technology companies is set to take
                            effect in the United Kingdom in 2020. Multilateral frameworks and consistent standards
                            would move the world closer to realizing the full economic potential of digital flows.

                            Building strong intellectual property protections is increasingly important in the age of
                            intangibles. Services and intellectual property are the frontiers of trade growth, and they
                            need to be more central in future trade agreements. Yet harmonizing the nontariff policies
                            that restrict trade in services is more complex than negotiating tariff levels. Varying national
                            regulations and certification standards can limit competition from foreign services providers
                            in fields such as medicine, law, engineering, and accounting. These types of entry barriers
                            prevent foreign competition and restrict choice, driving up the price of these services for
                            local consumers. The OECD estimates that the cost of these types of trade barriers on
                            services exceeds the average tariff on traded goods—and in some sectors and countries,
                            the cost is so large that it imposes the equivalent of an 80 percent tax, making trade
                            economically unviable.162

                            The next wave of technologies, including automation, AI, and 3-D printing, could make some
                            reshoring (or nearshoring) of manufacturing economically viable. Yet evidence is mixed.163
                            Proximity to the huge and lucrative US, European, and Japanese markets has always been
                            important, and the growing premium on speed to market, combined with shorter product
                            life cycles and opportunities for product customization, should reinforce this trend. However,
                            if some production does return to advanced economies, it is unlikely to be in a form that
                            would restore millions of low-skill assembly line jobs.

                            Perhaps the biggest policy challenge in advanced economies involves unfinished business
                            from the past—and the need to prepare for what comes next. No country has sufficiently
                            addressed the transitional costs borne disproportionately by certain industries, companies,
                            and workers. Local governments have often been overwhelmed when their communities
                            were caught up in national, global, and technological currents. Regions built on declining
                            industries need bolder initiatives and investment to nurture new industries.

                            The solutions will not be uniform everywhere, but the menu of options is far broader than
                            what has been tried to date. It includes transitional income support and other social
                            safety net programs for displaced workers. In the United States, portable benefits (health,
                            retirement, and family leave benefits that are not tied to a single employer) can also help

                      workers move more fluidly between jobs and employers. Workforce training programs will
                      also need to be overhauled to ensure that midcareer workers can shift into occupations
                      that are in demand. Creating incentives to boost workforce mobility may be helpful, and
                      relocation payments could help workers defray moving costs while seeking economic
                      opportunities elsewhere. Another priority for making globalization more inclusive is to ensure
                      that more small and medium-size firms can participate in exporting.

                      DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FACE HEADWINDS, BUT NEARSHORING AND THE
                      GROWTH OF SERVICES OFFER OPPORTUNITIES
                      While the trends favor advanced economies with skilled workforces, innovation ecosystems,
                      infrastructure, and institutions, developing countries that lack those comparative
                      advantages will need to carefully consider how and where to play in global value chains. The
                      emerging economies that have posted the fastest income growth over recent decades offer
                      some clues, although policy makers need to focus on the opportunities of the future.

                       Labor-intensive manufacturing still offers some opportunities, but the window will
                         not remain open indefinitely. For decades, fostering labor-intensive manufacturing for
                         export was seen as the best strategy for low-income countries to climb the economic
                         ladder. Now the window of opportunity is narrowing. As automation technologies are
                         adopted more widely in global manufacturing, the advantage of having a large low-
                         wage workforce is eroding.164 But the window is not closed yet, and countries that move
                         decisively may still be able to take advantage of this strategy.

                            Some low-income countries—most notably Vietnam, but also Bangladesh and India—
                            are still managing to achieve growth in labor-intensive manufacturing exports (Exhibit 39).
                            To continue to pursue this development path, these countries will need to invest in
                            transportation and logistics infrastructure, and encourage private and foreign investment
                            in modern, technology-enabled factories. Yet automation may limit job creation in labor-
                            intensive manufacturing in the years ahead, even as output continues to grow. These
                            countries will need to map out strategies for diversification. China is already making great
                            strides on this front and producing more intricate, innovative goods. India is also a major
                            player in IT services. Regional processing value chains may be a promising avenue for
                            other countries, since these industries are structured around the location of end markets.

                       Developing countries near large consumer markets may benefit from the growing
                         importance of speed to market, particularly in global innovations value chains.
                         One subset of developing countries has a critical advantage: geographic proximity to
                         major advanced-economy trading partners. Many of these countries already specialize
                         in global innovations value chains, and opportunities may grow. The growing premium
                         on locating production closer to end markets discussed in Chapter 5 works in their
                         favor, and automation will make continuously chasing the lowest-wage suppliers less
                         attractive for their advanced-economy trading partners. Companies are increasingly
                         looking for a balance that emphasizes proximity to demand and innovation.165 Several
                         developing countries with surpluses in global innovations (typically automotive) are taking
                         this development path. Just as Mexico has become an important trading partner for the
                         United States, Turkey and a number of Eastern European countries play this role in value
                         chains linked to Western Europe. Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia do the same for
                         higher-income Asia–Pacific countries (in addition to exporting more globally to Europe
                         and the United States). As labor costs rise in China, a growing number of Western
                         multinationals are considering nearshoring as a way to maintain tighter coordination
                         in their supply chains and cut down on shipping times. In some cases, nearshoring

                                       alternatives may offer fewer cultural, language, and time-zone difficulties than suppliers
                                       halfway around the world.

                                  Developing-country service providers stand to gain from growth in services trade,
                                    if they can move up the value chain as automation performs basic tasks. Another
                                    group of developing countries, including the Philippines, Morocco, and Costa Rica,
                                    specializes in traded BPO and IT services.166 (India, too, is a major provider of offshore
                                    services, although its biggest exports are still labor-intensive goods.) Their industries
                                    will be well positioned to expand as technology gives rise to new services and makes it
                                    possible to deliver others remotely. However, the ongoing development of AI and virtual
                                    agent tools may eat into the market for some of the services that are traded today,
                                    including customer service calls, data entry, and administrative work. These countries
                                    need to move into higher-value offerings where demand is growing. Some of the most
                                    promising areas appear to be software and web development, graphic design, and
                                    advanced data analysis.

                                 The challenges are getting steeper for the developing countries that missed out
                                 on the last wave of globalization
                                 Globalization has passed by many countries in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia. Not
                                 only is their participation in global value chains limited, but they are also less connected to
                                 the rest of the world in flows of finance, people, and data (as reflected in lower scores on
                                 the MGI Connectedness Index, shown in Exhibit 37, earlier in this chapter). These countries
                                 are at risk of falling further behind as new technologies substitute for labor and global value
                                 chains become more knowledge-intensive. Across the board, developing countries face a
                                 squeeze. On one side, their comparative advantage in traditional industries is eroding; on

                      the other, the bar is being set higher for the skills, infrastructure, and technologies required
                      to participate in the industries of the future.

                      One of the most important pathways for many developing countries may be deeper regional
                      integration in trade. Already we see the world shifting toward more intraregional and less
                      long-haul trade. Lowering tariffs on traded goods is only one aspect of regional integration;
                      it also involves harmonizing regulations, product and technical standards, customs
                      procedures, and capital markets as well as facilitating more seamless flows of people,
                      traded services, and data. In Southeast Asia, the ASEAN Economic Community is focused
                      on trying to achieve these goals across ten countries at widely varying stages of economic
                      development. The existing trading blocs in Latin America and Africa in particular could be
                      further developed to create trade opportunities. Since manufacturing industries such as
                      food processing are highly regional rather than long-haul, trade blocs can spur demand.
                      Spain has demonstrated that even in wealthier trading blocs, there is room to specialize,
                      particularly in food and beverage. In addition to regional processing, developing countries
                      can look at parts of the value chain that are more difficult to automate (focusing on complex
                      apparel, for instance, rather than simple commoditized garments).

                      Recent MGI research looked into what sets apart developing countries that manage
                      to achieve faster growth. The common pattern was a focus on increasing productivity
                      growth (often through incentives), enabling competition within sectors, and attracting
                      foreign investment and joint ventures to capture knowledge and technology spillovers.167
                      Another common characteristic was a focus on making government services more
                      efficient and streamlining bureaucracy to create more business-friendly climates. The role
                      of productive and globally competitive large firms in creating a virtuous cycle of growth is
                      often underappreciated.

                      One clear no-regrets move for all developing countries to deepen their participation in global
                      value chains is taking steps to reduce trade transaction costs. In many of these nations,
                      customs processing takes days, roads are poor, and ports are inefficient. According
                      to World Bank data, it takes 25 days on average in Gabon and 14 days in Uganda and
                      Malawi to deliver imported goods by land, compared to three days in France and Japan.
                      Technologies such as automated document processing and blockchain, combined with
                      investment in modernizing ports, could remove some of the frictions that constrain trade
                      growth, although the investment and implementation will be challenging.

                      The digital economy offers opportunities but also challenges. Internet penetration in the
                      developing world was estimated at 41 percent as of the end of 2017, but it remains much
                      lower in low-income countries.168 Internet access is trending in the right direction, but
                      much more work remains to be done to build out digital networks and bring the rest of the
                      population online. As the flow of ideas, information, and innovation becomes more central
                      to participating in the global economy, access to digital platforms and communication has
                      become an urgent development issue.

                      Yet new technologies hold possibilities for leapfrog growth. Not that long ago, these same
                      countries were held back by the poor quality of landline phone networks, but mobile phones
                      enabled them to bypass those infrastructure issues altogether, moving rapidly into a new
                      and more connected era of communications. Today mobile apps give small businesses
                      and entrepreneurs across the developing world new tools for analysis, sales, procurement,

                            and marketing—putting the same capabilities in their hands that large companies spent
                            hundreds of millions of dollars to develop in the 1990s and 2000s. Cloud computing
                            amplifies these trends, and it is taking off rapidly across Latin America and Africa. Amazon
                            Web Services, and Microsoft have recently announced the expansion of data centers and
                            public cloud services in Africa. Mobile banking could make financial inclusion for nearly one
                            billion individuals a reality.169 For businesses, financial-services providers, and governments,
                            digital payments and digital financial services can erase huge inefficiencies and unlock
                            significant productivity gains.

                            E-commerce marketplaces give small and medium-size businesses in developing countries
                            global exposure to customers and suppliers, payment infrastructure, and logistics
                            services. Taking advantage of their troves of data on small vendors, a number of the largest
                            e-commerce platforms offer additional small business services such as microloans. Digital
                            marketplaces for freelance labor (such as Upwork, Freelancer.com, Guru, and Fiverr) match
                            workers in the developing world with potential clients worldwide for tasks such as software
                            development, sales and marketing support, and creative work. One study analyzing four
                            of the largest labor platforms found that India was the top source of labor, followed by
                            Bangladesh, the United States, Pakistan, and the Philippines.170

                            Education and skills determine any country’s ability to participate in a more digital
                            global economy, particularly as value chains become more knowledge-intensive. This is
                            particularly true for countries attempting to build tradable service sectors, which are more
                            dependent on skilled workers.171 Once countries begin to participate, however, they can set
                            off a virtuous circle of benefits, as trade and foreign direct investment lead to knowledge and
                            technology spillovers.172

                                                                                     •••

                            This period of disruption represents an opening for countries and regions to carve out new
                            roles in global value chains. Policy makers everywhere are rightly concerned about the
                            impact of globalization on the welfare of workers and societies—and these questions will
                            deepen as new technologies replace labor in manufacturing and shift where production
                            takes place.
