     Preface

     McKinsey has long focused on issues of environmental sustainability, dating to client studies
     in the early 1970s. We developed our global greenhouse gas abatement cost curve in 2007,
     updated it in 2009, and have since conducted national abatement studies in countries
     including Brazil, China, Germany, India, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
     States. Recent publications include Shaping climate-resilient development: A framework for
     decision-making (jointly released with the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group
     in 2009), Towards the Circular Economy (joint publication with Ellen MacArthur Foundation
     in 2013), An integrated perspective on the future of mobility (2016), and Decarbonization
     of industrial sectors: The next frontier (2018). The McKinsey Global Institute has likewise
     published reports on sustainability topics including Resource revolution: Meeting the world’s
     energy, materials, food, and water needs (2011) and Beyond the supercycle: How technology
     is reshaping resources (2017).

     In this report, we look at the physical effects of our changing climate. We explore risks today
     and over the next three decades and examine cases to understand the mechanisms through
     which physical climate change leads to increased socioeconomic risk. We also estimate the
     probabilities and magnitude of potential impacts. Our aim is to help inform decision makers
     around the world so that they can better assess, adapt to, and mitigate the physical risks of
     climate change.

     This report is the product of a yearlong, cross-disciplinary research effort at McKinsey &
     Company, led by MGI together with McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice and McKinsey’s Risk
     Practice. The research was led by Jonathan Woetzel, an MGI director based in Shanghai, and
     Mekala Krishnan, an MGI senior fellow in Boston, together with McKinsey senior partners
     Dickon Pinner in San Francisco and Hamid Samandari in New York, partner Hauke Engel in
     Frankfurt, and associate partner Brodie Boland in Washington, DC. The project team was led
     by Tilman Melzer, Andrey Mironenko, and Claudia Kampel and consisted of Vassily Carantino,
     Peter Cooper, Peter De Ford, Jessica Dharmasiri, Jakob Graabak, Ulrike Grassinger, Zealan
     Hoover, Sebastian Kahlert, Dhiraj Kumar, Hannah Murdoch, Karin Östgren, Jemima Peppel,
     Pauline Pfuderer, Carter Powis, Byron Ruby, Sarah Sargent, Erik Schilling, Anna Stanley,
     Marlies Vasmel, and Johanna von der Leyen. Brian Cooperman, Eduardo Doryan, Jose Maria
     Quiros, Vivien Singer, and Sulay Solis provided modeling, analytics, and data support. Michael
     Birshan, David Fine, Lutz Goedde, Cindy Levy, James Manyika, Scott Nyquist, Vivek Pandit,
     Daniel Pacthod, Matt Rogers, Sven Smit, and Thomas Vahlenkamp provided critical input and
     considerable expertise.

     While McKinsey employs many scientists, including climate scientists, we are not a climate
     research institution. Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC) produced the scientific
     analyses of physical climate hazards in this report. WHRC has been focused on climate
     science research since 1985; its scientists are widely published in major scientific journals,
     testify to lawmakers around the world, and are regularly sourced in major media outlets.
     Methodological design and results were independently reviewed by senior scientists at
     the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute to ensure impartiality and test
     the scientific foundation for the new analyses in this report. Final design choices and
     interpretation of climate hazard results were made by WHRC. In addition, WHRC scientists
     produced maps and data visualization for the report.

     We would like to thank our academic advisers, who challenged our thinking and added
     new insights: Dr. Richard N. Cooper, Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics
     at Harvard University; Dr. Cameron Hepburn, director of the Economics of Sustainability

Executive summary
McKinsey has a long history of research on topics related to the economics of climate
change. Over the past decade, we have published a variety of research including a cost curve
illustrating feasible approaches to abatement and reports on understanding the economics
of adaptation and identifying the potential to improve resource productivity.1 This research
builds on that work and focuses on understanding the nature and implications of physical
climate risk in the next three decades.

We draw on climate model forecasts to showcase how the climate has changed and could
continue to change, how a changing climate creates new risks and uncertainties, and what
steps can be taken to best manage them. Climate impact research makes extensive use
of scenarios. Four “Representative Concentration Pathways“ (RCPs) act as standardized
inputs to climate models. They outline different atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration
trajectories between 2005 and 2100. During their inception, RCPs were designed to
collectively sample the range of then-probable future emission pathways, ranging from lower
(RCP2.6) to higher (RCP 8.5) CO2 concentrations. Each RCP was created by an independent
modeling team and there is no consistent design of the socio-economic parameter
assumptions used in the derivation of the RCPs. By 2100, the four RCPs lead to very different
levels of warming, but the divergence is moderate out to 2050 and small to 2030. Since the
research in this report is most concerned with understanding inherent physical risks, we
have chosen to focus on the higher-emission scenario, i.e. RCP 8.5, because of the higher-
emissions, lower-mitigation scenario it portrays, in order to assess physical risk in absence of
further decarbonization (Exhibit E1).

We focus on physical risk—that is, the risks arising from the physical effects of climate
change, including the potential effects on people, communities, natural and physical capital,
and economic activity, and the implications for companies, governments, financial institutions,
and individuals. Physical risk is the fundamental driver of other climate risk types—
transition risk and liability risk.2 We do not focus on transition risks, that is, impacts from
decarbonization, or liability risks associated with climate change. While an understanding
of decarbonization and the risk and opportunities it creates is a critical topic, this report
contributes by exploring the nature and costs of ongoing climate change in the next one to
three decades in the absence of decarbonization.

    those affected by climate change seeking compensation for losses. See Climate change: What are the risks to financial

                                     Our work offers both a call to action and a set of tools and methodologies to help assess
                                     the socioeconomic risks posed by climate change. We assess the socioeconomic risk
                                     from “acute” hazards, which are one-off events like floods or hurricanes, as well as from
                                     “chronic” hazards, which are long-term shifts in climate parameters like temperature. 3
                                     We look at two periods: between now and 2030 and from 2030 to 2050. In doing so, we
                                     have relied on climate hazard data from climate scientists and focused on establishing
                                     socioeconomic impact, given potential changes in climate hazards (see Box E1, “Our research
                                     methodology”). We develop a methodology to measure the risk from the changing climate
                                     and the uncertainties associated with these estimates (see Box E2, “How our methodology
                                     addresses uncertainties”). At the end of this executive summary, we highlight questions for
                                     stakeholders seeking to respond to the challenge of heightened physical climate risk (see Box
                                     E3, “Questions for individual stakeholders to consider”).

We make use of RCP 8.5, because the higher-emission scenario it portrays enables us to
assess physical risk in the absence of further decarbonization.

Our research methodology

In this report, we measure the impact of climate change by the extent to which it could
affect human beings, human-made physical assets, and the natural world. While many
scientists, including climate scientists, are employed at McKinsey & Company, we are not
a climate modeling institution. Our focus in this report has been on translating the climate
science data into an assessment of physical risk and its implications for stakeholders.
Most of the climatological analysis performed for this report was done by Woods Hole
Research Center (WHRC), and in other instances, we relied on publicly available climate
science data, for example from institutions like the World Resources Institute. WHRC’s work
draws on the most widely used and thoroughly peer-reviewed ensemble of climate models
to estimate the probabilities of relevant climate events occurring. Here, we highlight key
methodological choices:

Case studies
In order to link physical climate risk to socioeconomic impact, we investigate nine specific
cases that illustrate exposure to climate change extremes and proximity to physical
thresholds. These cover a range of sectors and geographies and provide the basis of a “micro-
to-macro” approach that is a characteristic of MGI research. To inform our selection of cases,
we considered over 30 potential combinations of climate hazards, sectors, and geographies
based on a review of the literature and expert interviews on the potential direct impacts of
physical climate hazards. We find these hazards affect five different key socioeconomic
systems: livability and workability, food systems, physical assets, infrastructure services, and
natural capital.

We ultimately chose nine cases to reflect these systems and based on their exposure to the
extremes of climate change and their proximity today to key physiological, human-made, and
ecological thresholds. As such, these cases represent leading-edge examples of climate
change risk. They show that the direct risk from climate hazards is determined by the severity
of the hazard and its likelihood, the exposure of various “stocks” of capital (people, physical
capital, and natural capital) to these hazards, and the resilience of these stocks to the hazards
(for example, the ability of physical assets to withstand flooding). Through our case studies,
we also assess the knock-on effects that could occur, for example to downstream sectors or
consumers. We primarily rely on past examples and empirical estimates for this assessment
of knock-on effects, which is likely not exhaustive given the complexities associated
with socioeconomic systems. Through this “micro” approach, we offer decision makers
a methodology by which to assess direct physical climate risk, its characteristics, and its
potential knock-on impacts.

Global geospatial analysis
In a separate analysis, we use geospatial data to provide a perspective on climate change
across 105 countries over the next 30 years. This geospatial analysis relies on the same
five-systems framework of direct impacts that we used for the case studies. For each of
these systems, we identify a measure, or measures, of the impact of climate change, using
indicators where possible as identified in our cases.

Similar to the approach discussed above for our cases, our analyses are conducted at a
grid-cell level, overlaying data on a hazard (for example, floods of different depths, with their
associated likelihoods), with exposure to that hazard (for example, capital stock exposed
to flooding), and a damage function that assesses resilience (for example, what share of
capital stock is damaged when exposed to floods of different depth). We then combine these
grid-cell values to country and global numbers. While the goal of this analysis is to measure
direct impact, due to data availability issues, we have used five measures of socioeconomic
impact and one measure of climate hazards themselves—drought. Our set of 105 countries
represents 90 percent of the world’s population and 90 percent of global GDP. While we seek

    to include a wide range of risks and as many countries as possible, there are some we could
    not cover due to data limitations (for example, the impact of forest fires and storm surges).

    What this report does not do
    Since the purpose of this report is to understand the physical risks and disruptive impacts of
    climate change, there are many areas which we do not address.

    — We do not assess the efficacy of climate models but instead draw on best practice
      approaches from climate science literature and highlight key uncertainties.

    — We do not examine in detail areas and sectors that are likely to benefit from climate
      change such as the potential for improved agricultural yields in parts of Canada, although
      we quantify some of these benefits through our geospatial analysis.

    — As the consequences of physical risk are realized, there will likely be acts of adaptation,
      with a feedback effect on the physical risk. For each of our cases, we identify adaptation
      responses. We have not conducted a detailed bottom-up cost-benefit analysis of
      adaptation but have built on existing literature and expert interviews to understand the
      most important measures and their indicative cost, effectiveness, and implementation
      challenges, and to estimate the expected global adaptation spending required.

    — We note the critical importance of decarbonization in a climate risk management approach
      but a detailed discussion of decarbonization is beyond the scope of this report.

    — While we attempt to draw out qualitatively (and, to the extent possible, quantitatively)
      the knock-on effects from direct physical impacts of climate change, we recognize the
      limitations of this exercise given the complexity of socioeconomic systems. There are likely
      knock-on effects that could occur which our analysis has not taken into account. For this
      reason, we do not attempt to size the global GDP at risk from climate change (see Box 4 in
      Chapter 4 for a detailed discussion).

    — We do not provide projections or deterministic forecasts, but rather assess risk.
      The climate is the statistical summary of weather patterns over time and is therefore
      probabilistic in nature. Following standard practice, our findings are therefore framed as
      “statistically expected values”—the statistically expected average impact across a range
      of probabilities of higher or lower climate outcomes.1




    1
        We also report the value of “tail risks”—that is, low-probability, high-impact events like a 1-in-100‑year storm—on both an
        annual and cumulative basis. Consider, for example, a flooding event that has a 1 percent annual likelihood of occurrence
        every year (often described as a “100‑year flood”). In the course of the lifetime of home ownership—for example, over a
        30‑year period—the cumulative likelihood that the home will experience at least one 100‑year flood is 26 percent.

We find that risk from climate change is already present and growing. The insights from our
cases help highlight the nature of this risk, and therefore how stakeholders should think about
assessing and managing it. Seven characteristics stand out. Physical climate risk is:

— Increasing. In each of our nine cases, the level of physical climate risk increases by 2030 and
  further by 2050. Across our cases, we find increases in socioeconomic impact of between
  roughly two and 20 times by 2050 versus today’s levels. We also find physical climate
  risks are generally increasing across our global country analysis even as some countries
  find some benefits (such as increased agricultural yields in Canada, Russia, and parts of
  northern Europe).

— Spatial. Climate hazards manifest locally. The direct impacts of physical climate risk thus
  need to be understood in the context of a geographically defined area. There are variations
  between countries and also within countries.

— Non-stationary. As the Earth continues to warm, physical climate risk is ever-changing or
  non-stationary. Climate models and basic physics predict that further warming is “locked
  in” over the next decade due to inertia in the geophysical system, and that the temperature
  will likely continue to increase for decades to come due to socio-technological inertia in
  reducing emissions. 4 Climate science tells us that further warming and risk increase can only
  be stopped by achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, given the thermal
  inertia of the earth system, some amount of warming will also likely occur after net-zero
  emissions are reached. 5 Managing that risk will thus require not moving to a “new normal”
  but preparing for a world of constant change. Financial markets, companies, governments,
  or individuals have mostly not had to address being in an environment of constant change
  before, and decision making based on experience may no longer be reliable. For example,
  engineering parameters for infrastructure design in certain locations will need to be
  re-thought, and home owners may need to adjust assumptions about taking on long-term
  mortgages in certain geographies.

— Nonlinear. Socioeconomic impacts are likely to propagate in a nonlinear way as hazards
  reach thresholds beyond which the affected physiological, human-made, or ecological
  systems work less well or break down and stop working altogether. This is because such
  systems have evolved or been optimized over time for historical climates. Consider, for
  example, buildings designed to withstand floods of a certain depth, or crops grown in
  regions with a specific climate. While adaptation in theory can be carried out at a fairly
  rapid rate for some systems (for example, improving the floodproofing of a factory), the
  current rate of warming—which is at least an order of magnitude faster than any found in
  the past 65 million years of paleoclimate records—means that natural systems such as
  crops are unable to evolve fast enough to keep pace.6 Impacts could be significant if system
  thresholds are breached even by small amounts. The occurrence of multiple risk factors
  (for example, exposure to multiple hazards, other vulnerabilities like the ability to finance
  adaptation investments, or high reliance on a sector that is exposed to climate hazard)
  in a single geography, something we see in several of our cases, is a further source of
  potential nonlinearity.

— Systemic. While the direct impact from climate change is local, it can have knock-on effects
  across regions and sectors, through interconnected socioeconomic and financial systems.
  For example, flooding in Florida could not only damage housing but also raise insurance
  costs, affect property values of exposed homes, and in turn reduce property tax revenues

    Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                                     7


        for communities. Like physical systems, many economic and financial systems have
        been designed in a manner that could make them vulnerable to a changing climate. For
        example, global production systems like supply chains or food production systems have
        optimized efficiency over resiliency, which makes them vulnerable to failure if critical
        production hubs are impacted by intensifying hazards. Insurance systems are designed so
        that property insurance is re-priced annually; however, home owners often have longer-
        term time horizons of 30 years or more on their real estate investments. As a result of this
        duration mismatch, home owners could be exposed to the risk of higher costs, in the form
        of rising premiums (which could be appropriate to reflect rising risks), or impacts on the
        availability of insurance. Similarly, debt levels in many places are also at thresholds, so
        knock-on effects on relatively illiquid financial instruments like municipal bonds should
        also be considered.

    — Regressive. The poorest communities and populations within each of our cases typically
      are the most vulnerable. Across all 105 countries in our analysis, we find an increase in at
      least one of six indicators of socioeconomic impact by 2030. Emerging economies face
      the biggest increase in potential impact on workability and livability. Poorer countries
      also rely more on outdoor work and natural capital and have less financial means to adapt
      quickly. Climate change can bring benefits as well as costs to specific areas, for example
      shifting tourism from southern to northern Europe.

    — Under-prepared. While companies and communities have been adapting to reduce
      climate risk, the pace and scale of adaptation are likely to need to significantly increase
      to manage rising levels of physical climate risk. Adaptation is likely to entail rising costs
      and tough choices that may include whether to invest in hardening or relocate people and
      assets. It thus requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders.


    Climate change is already having substantial physical impacts at a local
    level; these impacts are likely to grow, intensify, and multiply
    Earth’s climate is changing, and further change is unavoidable in the next decade and in all
    likelihood beyond. The planet’s temperature has risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius on average
    since the 1880s.7 This has been confirmed by both satellite measurements and by the analysis
    of hundreds of thousands of independent weather station observations from across the
    globe. The rapid decline in the planet’s surface ice cover provides further evidence. This rate
    of warming is at least an order of magnitude faster than any found in the past 65 million years
    of paleoclimate records. 8

    The average conceals more dramatic changes at the extremes. In statistical terms,
    distributions of temperature are shifting to the right (towards warmer) and broadening. That
    means the average day in many locations is now hotter (“shifting means”), and extremely
    hot days are becoming more likely (“fattening tails”). For example, the evolution of the
    distribution of observed average summer temperatures for each 100-by-100-kilometer
    square in the Northern Hemisphere shows that the mean summer temperature has increased
    over time (Exhibit E2). The percentage of the Northern Hemisphere (in square kilometers)
    that experiences a substantially hotter summer—a two-standard-deviation warmer average
    temperature in a given year—has increased more than 15 times, from less than 1 percent to
    15 percent. The share of the Northern Hemisphere (in square kilometers) that experiences
    an extremely hot summer—three-standard-deviation hotter average temperature in a given
    summer—has increased from zero to half a percent.

    Averages also conceal wide spatial disparities. Over the same period that the Earth globally
    has warmed by 1.1 degrees, in southern parts of Africa and in the Arctic, average temperatures

                                      have risen by 0.2 and 0.5 degrees Celsius and by 4 to 4.3 degrees Celsius, respectively.9
                                      In general, the land surface has warmed faster than the 1.1-degree global average, and the
                                      oceans, which have a higher heat capacity, have warmed less.

                                      Looking forward, further change is unavoidable over the next decade at least, and in all
                                      likelihood beyond. The primary driver of the observed rate of temperature increase over the
                                      past two centuries is the human-caused rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
                                      other greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.10 Since the beginning of the
                                      Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century, humans have released nearly 2.5 trillion tonnes
                                      of CO2 into the atmosphere, raising atmospheric CO2 concentrations from about 280 parts
                                      per million by volume (ppmv) to 415 ppmv, increasing at more than 2 ppmv per year .

     Carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.11 As a result, in the absence
     of large-scale human action to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, nearly all of the warming that
     occurs will be permanent on societally relevant timescales.12 Additionally, because of the strong
     thermal inertia of the ocean, more warming is likely already locked in over the next decade,
     regardless of emissions pathway. Beyond 2030, climate science tells us that further warming
     and risk increase can only be stopped by achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions.13

     With increases in global average temperatures, climate models indicate a rise in climate
     hazards globally. According to climate science, further warming will continue to increase
     the frequency and/or severity of acute climate hazards across the world, such as lethal heat
     waves, extreme precipitation, and hurricanes, and will further intensify chronic hazards such as
     drought, heat stress, and rising sea levels.14 Here, we describe the prediction of climate models
     analyzed by WHRC, and also publicly available data for a selection of hazards for an RCP
     8.5 scenario (Exhibits E3 and E4):

     — Increase in average temperatures.15 Global average temperatures are expected to
       increase over the next three decades, resulting in a 2.3-degree Celsius (+0.5/-0.3)
       average increase relative to the preindustrial period by 2050, under an RCP 8.5 scenario.
       Depending on the exact location, this can translate to an average local temperature
       increase of between 1.5 and 5.0 degrees Celsius relative to today. The Arctic in particular is
       expected to warm more rapidly than elsewhere.

     — Extreme precipitation.16 In parts of the world, extreme precipitation events, defined here
       as one that was a once in a 50‑year event (that is, with a 2 percent annual likelihood) in
       the 1950–81 period, are expected to become more common. The likelihood of extreme
       precipitation events is expected to grow more than fourfold in some regions, including parts
       of China, Central Africa, and the east coast of North America compared with the period
       1950–81.

     — Hurricanes.17 While climate change is seen as unlikely to alter the frequency of tropical
       hurricanes, climate models and basic physical theory predict an increase in the average
       severity of those storms (and thus an increase in the frequency of severe hurricanes). The
       likelihood of severe hurricane precipitation—that is, an event with a 1 percent likelihood
       annually in the 1981–2000 period—is expected to double in some parts of the southeastern
       United States and triple in some parts of Southeast Asia by 2040. Both are densely
       populated areas with large and globally connected economic activity.

     — Drought.18 As the Earth warms, the spatial extent and share of time spent in drought is
       projected to increase. The share of a decade spent in drought conditions is projected to be
       up to 80 percent in some parts of the world by 2050, notably in parts of the Mediterranean,
       southern Africa, and Central and South America.

          This list of climate hazards is a subset, and the full list can be found in the full report. The list is illustrative rather than
          exhaustive. Due to data and modeling constraints, we did not include the following hazards: increased frequency and
          severity of forest fires, increased biological and ecological impacts from pests and diseases, increased severity of
          hurricane wind speed and storm surge, and more frequent and severe coastal flooding due to sea-level rise.

2. A lethal heat wave is defined as a three-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb, where wet-bulb
   temperature is defined as the lowest temperature to which a parcel of air can be cooled by evaporation at constant pressure. This threshold was
   chosen because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island
   effects could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. Under these conditions, a healthy, well-hydrated human being resting in
   the shade would see core body temperatures rise to lethal levels after roughly 4–5 hours of exposure. These projections are subject to uncertainty
   related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.

— Lethal heat waves.19 Lethal heat waves are defined as three-day events during which
  average daily maximum wet-bulb temperature could exceed the survivability threshold
  for a healthy human being resting in the shade.20 Under an RCP 8.5 scenario, urban
  areas in parts of India and Pakistan could be the first places in the world to experience
  heat waves that exceed the survivability threshold for a healthy human being, with small
  regions projected to experience a more than 60 percent annual chance of such a heat
  wave by 2050.

— Water supply.21 As rainfall patterns, evaporation, snowmelt timing, and other factors
  change, renewable freshwater supply will be affected. Some parts of the world like South
  Africa and Australia are expected to see a decrease in water supply, while other areas,
  including Ethiopia and parts of South America, are projected to experience an increase.
  Certain regions, for example, parts of the Mediterranean region and parts of the United
  States and Mexico, are projected to see a decrease in mean annual surface water supply
  of more than 70 percent by 2050. Such a large decline in water supply could cause or
  exacerbate chronic water stress and increase competition for resources across sectors.


The socioeconomic impacts of climate change will likely be nonlinear as
system thresholds are breached and have knock-on effects
Climate change affects human life as well as the factors of production on which our economic
activity is based and, by extension, the preservation and growth of wealth. We measure the
impact of climate change by the extent to which it could disrupt or destroy stocks of capital—
human, physical, and natural—and the resultant socioeconomic impact of that disruption or
destruction. The effect on economic activity as measured by GDP is a consequence of the
direct impacts on these stocks of capital.

Climate change is already having a measurable socioeconomic impact. Across the world, we
find examples of these impacts and their linkage to climate change. We group these impacts
in a five-systems framework (Exhibit E5). As noted in Box E1, this impact framework is our best
effort to capture the range of socioeconomic impacts from physical climate hazards.

      We define a lethal heat wave as a three-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34 degrees
     Celsius wet-bulb, where wet-bulb temperature is defined as the lowest temperature to which a parcel of air can be
     cooled by evaporation at constant pressure. This threshold was chosen because the commonly defined heat threshold
     for human survivability is 35 degrees Celsius wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects could
     push 34C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35C threshold. At this temperature, a healthy human being, resting in the shade,
     can survive outdoors for four to five hours. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior
     of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects. If a non-zero probability of lethal heat waves in
     certain regions occurred in the models for today, this was set to zero to account for the poor representation of the high
     levels of observed atmospheric aerosols in those regions in the CMIP5 models. High levels of atmospheric aerosols
     provide a cooling effect that masks the risk. See the India case and our technical appendix for more details. Analysis

Individual climate hazards could impact multiple systems. For example, extreme heat may
affect communities through lethal heat waves and daylight hours rendered unworkable, even
as it shifts food systems, disrupts infrastructure services, and endangers natural capital such
as glaciers. Extreme precipitation and flooding can destroy physical assets and infrastructure
while endangering coastal and river communities. Hurricanes can impact global supply
chains, and biome shifts can affect ecosystem services. The five systems in our impact
framework are:

— Livability and workability. Hazards like heat stress could affect the ability of human
  beings to work outdoors or, in extreme cases, could put human lives at risk. Heat reduces
  labor capacity because workers must take breaks to avoid heatstroke and because the
  body naturally limits its efforts to prevent overexertion. Increased temperatures could also
  shift disease vectors and thus affect human health.

— Food systems. Food production could be disrupted as drought conditions, extreme
  temperatures, or floods affect land and crops. A changing climate could both improve and
  degrade food system performance while introducing more or less volatility. In some cases,
  crop yields may increase; in other cases, thresholds could be exceeded beyond which
  some crops fail entirely.

— Physical assets. Physical assets like buildings could be damaged or destroyed by
  extreme precipitation, tidal flooding, forest fires, and other hazards. Hazards could even
  materially affect an entire network of assets such as a city’s central business district.

— Infrastructure services. Infrastructure assets are a particular type of physical asset that
  could be destroyed or disrupted in their functioning, leading to a decline in the services
  they provide or a rise in the cost of these services. For example, power systems could
  become less productive under very hot conditions. A range of hazards including heat,
  wind, and flooding can disrupt infrastructure services. This in turn can have knock-on
  effects on other sectors that rely on these infrastructure assets.

— Natural capital. Climate change is shifting ecosystems and destroying forms of natural
  capital such as glaciers, forests, and ocean ecosystems, which provide important services
  to human communities. This in turn imperils the human habitat and economic activity.
  These impacts are hard to model but could be nonlinear and in some cases irreversible,
  such as glacier melting, as the temperature rises. In some cases, human mismanagement
  may play a role—for example, with forest fires and water scarcity—but its extent and
  impact are multiplied by climate change.

The nine distinct cases of physical climate risk in various geographies and sectors that we
examine, including direct impact and knock-on effects, as well as adaptation costs and
strategies, help illustrate the specific socioeconomic impact of the different physical climate
hazards on the examined human, physical, or natural system. Our cases cover each of the
five systems across geographies and include multiple climate hazards, sometimes occurring
at the same location. Overall, our cases highlight a wide range of vulnerabilities to the
changing climate.

Specifically, we looked at the impact of climate change on livability and workability in India
and the Mediterranean; disruption of food systems through looking at global breadbaskets
and African agriculture; physical asset destruction in residential real estate in Florida and
in supply chains for semiconductors and heavy rare earth metals; disruption of five types of
infrastructure services and, in particular, the threat of flooding to urban areas; and destruction
of natural capital through impacts on glaciers, oceans, and forests.




Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                             15


     Our case studies highlight that physical climate risk is growing, often in nonlinear ways.
     Physical climate impacts are spreading across regions, even as the hazards grow more
     intense within regions.

     To assess the magnitude of direct physical climate risk in each case, we examine the severity
     of the hazard and its likelihood; the exposure of people, assets, or economic activity to the
     hazard; and the extent to which systems are vulnerable to the hazard. Researchers have
     examined insurance data on losses from natural disasters and found that most of the increase
     in direct impact to date has come more from greater exposure than from increases in the
     climate hazards themselves.22 Changes in climate itself in the future are likely to play a bigger
     role. As the Earth warms, hazards will become more intense and or more frequent. Since
     physiological, human-made, and ecological systems have evolved or been optimized over time
     for historical climates, even small changes in hazard intensity can have large consequences if
     physical thresholds for resilience are breached.

     Indeed, thresholds exist for all systems we have examined. For example: the human body
     functions at a stable core temperature of about 37 degrees Celsius, above which physical
     and mental functioning could be fatally impaired; corn yields can decline significantly above
     20 degrees Celsius; cell phone towers have typically been built to withstand certain wind
     speeds above which they may fail (Exhibit E6).

     The impacts, once such thresholds are crossed, could be significant. For example, by 2030 in
     an RCP 8.5 scenario, absent an effective adaptation response, we estimate that 160 million to
     200 million people in India could live in regions with a 5 percent average annual probability of
     experiencing a heat wave that exceeds the survivability threshold for a healthy human being
     (without factoring in air conditioner penetration).23

     Outdoor labor productivity is also expected to fall, thus reducing the effective number of
     hours that can be worked outdoors (Exhibit E7). As of 2017, in India, heat-exposed work
     produces about 50 percent of GDP, drives about 30 percent of GDP growth, and employs
     about 75 percent of the labor force, some 380 million people.24 By 2030, the average number
     of lost daylight working hours in India could increase to the point where between 2.5 and
     4.5 percent of GDP could be at risk annually, according to our estimates.

          Various researchers have attempted to identify the role played by each of these factors in driving economic losses
          to date. Insurance records of losses from acute natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, and forest fires show a clear
          upward trend in losses in real terms over time, and analyses show that the majority of this is driven by an increase in
          exposure. This is based on normalizing the real losses for increases in GDP, wealth, and exposure to strip out the effects
          of a rise in exposure. See for example, Roger Pielke, “Tracking progress on the economic costs of disasters under the
          indicators of the sustainable development goals,” Environmental Hazards, 2019, Volume 18, Number 1. The work by Pielke
          finds no upward trend in economic impact after normalizing the damage data, and indeed a decrease in weather /climate
          losses as a proportion of GDP since 1990. Other researchers find a small upward trend after accounting for effects of
          GDP, wealth, and population, suggesting some potential role of climate change in losses to date. See for example, Fabian
          Barthel and Eric Neumayer, “A trend analysis of normalized insured damage from natural disasters,” Climatic Change,
          2012, Volume 113, Number 2; Robert Muir-Wood et al., “The search for trends in a global catalogue of normalized weather-
          related catastrophe losses,” Climate Change and Disaster Losses Workshop, May 2006; and Robert Ward and Nicola
          Ranger, Trends in economic and insured losses from weather-related events: A new analysis, Centre for Climate Change
          Economics and Policy and Munich Re, November 2010. For example, Muir-Wood et al. conduct analysis of insurance
          industry data between 1970 to 2005 and find that weather-related catastrophe losses have increased by 2 percent each
          year since the 1970s, after accounting for changes in wealth, population growth and movement, and inflation (notably,
          though, in some regions including Australia, India, and the Philippines, such losses have declined). Analysis by Munich
          Re finds a statistically significant increase in insured losses from weather-related events in the United States and in
          Germany over the past approximately 30 to 40 years.

          A lethal heat wave is defined as a three-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34 degrees
          Celsius wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is
          35 degrees Celsius wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects could push 34C wet-bulb heat
          waves over the 35C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric
          aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects. If a non-zero probability of lethal heat waves in certain regions
          occurred in the models for today, this was set to zero to account for the poor representation of the high levels of observed
          atmospheric aerosols in those regions in the CMIP5 models. High levels of atmospheric aerosols provide a cooling effect
          that masks the risk. See India case for further details. This analysis excludes grid-cells where the likelihood of lethal heat
          waves is <1 percent, to eliminate areas of low statistical significance.

1. Immediate effect; longer exposure will cause rapidly worsening health impacts. Humans can survive exposure to 35C wet-bulb temperatures for
   between four to five hours. During this period, it is possible for a small amount of work to be performed, which is why the working hours curve does
   not approach zero at 35C WBGT (which, in the shade, is approximately equivalent to 35C wet-bulb).

Economic and financial systems have similarly been designed and optimized for a certain level
of risk and increasing hazards may mean that such systems are vulnerable. We have already
noted that supply chains are often designed for efficiency over resiliency, by concentrating
production in certain locations and maintaining low inventory levels. Food production is also
heavily concentrated; just five regional “breadbasket” areas account for about 60 percent of
global grain production. Rising climate hazards might therefore cause such systems to fail,
for example if key production hubs are affected. Finance and insurance have vulnerabilities,
too; while they were designed to manage for some level of risk, intensifying climate hazards
could stretch their limits. For example, consider the residential real estate market in Florida
(Exhibit E8). Home owners rely on insurance to build financial resilience against risks like
floods, but premiums could rise in the face of increasing risk and insurance does not cover
devaluations of home prices. Lenders may bear some risk if home owners default. Among
other possible repercussions, federal governments have been acting as backstops but may
need to be prepared to finance more.

Other cases we examined highlight large knock-on impacts when thresholds are breached.
These come about in particular when the people and assets affected are central to local
economies and those local economies are tied into other economic and financial systems.

Ho Chi Minh City, a city prone to monsoonal and storm surge flooding, is one example. We
estimate that direct infrastructure asset damage from a 100‑year flood today would be on
the order of $200 million to $300 million. This could rise to $500 million to $1 billion in 2050,
assuming no additional adaptation investment and not including real estate–related impacts.
Beyond this direct damage, we estimate that the knock-on costs could be substantial. They
would rise from $100 million to $400 million today to between $1.5 billion and as much as
$8.5 billion in 2050. We estimate that at least $20 billion of new infrastructure assets are
currently planned for construction by 2050, more than doubling the number of major assets
in Ho Chi Minh City (Exhibit E9). Many of these new infrastructure assets, particularly the local
metro system, have been designed to tolerate an increase in flooding. However, in a worst-
case scenario such as a sea-level rise of 180 centimeters, these thresholds could be breached
in many locations.25

A further example from our case studies, that of coastal real estate in Florida, shows how
climate hazards could have unpredictable financial impacts. The geography of Florida, with its
expansive coastline, low elevation, and porous limestone foundation, makes it vulnerable to
flooding. Absent any adaptation response, direct physical damages to real estate could grow
with the changing climate. Average annual losses for residential real estate due to storm surge
from hurricanes amount to $2 billion today. This is projected to increase to about $3 billion
to $4.5 billion by 2050, depending on whether exposure is constant or increasing.26 For a tail
100‑year hurricane event, storm surge damages could rise from $35 billion today to between
$50 billion and $75 billion by 2050.




25
     This scenario is extreme, and the probability of it occurring by 2050 is negligible. Nonetheless, it illustrates that
     infrastructure planned for completion in or shortly before 2050 could experience another step change in risk at some
     point in 2060 or beyond if significant mitigation does not take place.
26
      Analysis conducted by KatRisk; direct average annual losses to all residential real estate (insured and uninsured
     properties). This is the long-term average loss expected in any one year, calculated by modeling the probability of a
     climate hazard occurring multiplied by the damage should that hazard occur, and summing over events of all probabilities.

     from the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact
     Sea Level Rise Work Group, Unified sea level rise projection: Southeast Florida, October 2015. More broadly, considering
     the hurricane hazard, while total hurricane frequency is expected to remain unchanged or to decrease slightly as the
     climate changes, cumulative hurricane rainfall rates, average intensity, and proportion of storms that reach Category 4–5
     intensity are projected to increase, even for a 2°C or less increase in global average temperatures. Thomas Knutson et al.,

     These numbers do not include the potential devaluation of flooding affected real estate. Exposed
     homes could see a devaluation of $30 billion to $80 billion, or about 15 to 35 percent, by 2050,
     all else being equal.27 Lower real estate prices could in turn have knock-on effects, including
     forgone property tax revenue (a major source of state income), reduced wealth and spending by
     home owners, reduced, halted, or reversed resident inflow, and forced changes in government
     spending. For example, rough estimates suggest that the price effects discussed above could
     impact property tax revenue in some of the most affected counties by about 15 to 30 percent
     (though impacts across the state could be less, at about 2 to 5 percent). Business activity could
     be negatively affected, as could the availability and/or price of insurance and mortgage financing
     in high-risk counties. Financial markets could bring these risks forward, and the recognition
     of large future changes could lead to price adjustments. Awareness of climate risk could make
     long-duration borrowing more expensive or unavailable and reduce valuations, for example. This
     recognition could happen quickly, with the possibility of cascading consequences.

     Climate change could create inequality—simultaneously benefiting some regions while hurting
     others. For example, rising temperatures may boost tourism in areas of northern Europe while
     reducing the economic vitality of southern European resorts. The volume of water in basins in
     northern Africa, Greece, and Spain could decline by more than 15 percent by 2050 even as volume
     in basins in Germany and the Netherlands increases by between 1 and 5 percent.28 The mild
     Mediterranean climate is expected to grow hotter—by 2050, the climate in the French port city of
     Marseille could more closely resemble that of Algiers today—which could disrupt key sectors such
     as tourism and agriculture.29

     Within regions, the poorest communities and populations within each of our cases typically
     are the most vulnerable to climate events. They often lack financial means. For example, acute
     climate events could trigger harvest failure in multiple breadbasket locations—that is, significantly
     lower-than-average yields in two or more key production regions for rice, wheat, corn, and soy.
     We estimate that the chance of a greater than 15 percent yield shock at least once in the decade
     centered on 2030 could rise from 10 percent today to 18 percent, while the chance of a greater
     than 10 percent yield shock occurring at least once could rise from 46 to 69 percent. 30 Given
     current high grain stocks, totaling about 30 percent of consumption, the world would not run out
     of grain. However, historical precedent suggests that prices could spike by 100 percent or more
     in the short term, in the event of a greater than 15 percent decline in global supply that reduces
     stocks. This would particularly hurt the poorest communities, including the 750 million people
     living below the international poverty line.


     The global socioeconomic impacts of climate change could be substantial as
     a changing climate directly affects human, physical, and natural capital
     While our case studies illustrate the localized impacts of a changing climate, rising temperatures
     are a global trend. To understand how physical climate hazards could evolve around the world,
     we developed a global geospatial assessment of climate impacts over the next 30 years covering
     105 countries. 31 We again rely on our framework of the direct impacts of climate change on five
     human, physical, and natural systems. For each system we have identified one or more measures

          Analysis supported by First Street Foundation, 2019. Ranges based on whether homes that frequently flood (>50x per year),
          see more significant devaluations or not. Note that other factors could also affect the prices of homes and that has not been
          factored in. Much of the literature finds that, at least historically, prices of exposed properties have risen slower than prices of
          unexposed properties, rather than declined in absolute terms. For further details, see the Florida case study.

     30
          To estimate the likelihood, we employ crop models from the AgMIP model library that translate outputs from climate models
          into crop yields for each modeled grid cell. Using all available climate models over a period of 20 years, we construct a
          probability distribution of yields for each crop in each grid cell. Note that we are taking into account potentially positive
          effects on plant growth from higher CO2 levels (“CO2 fertilization”). Analysis is based on an assumption of no improvements in
          agricultural productivity (consistent with our “inherent risk” framing). See breadbasket case for further details.
     31
          To conduct this analysis, we have relied on geospatial climate hazard data, including from Woods Hole Research Center
          analysis of CMIP5 Global Climate Model output, the World Resources Institute, the European Center for Medium-Range
          Weather Forecasts and data from Rubel et al. (obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). We used
          geospatial data on population, capital stock, and GDP from the European Commission Global Human Settlement (GHS) and
          the UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, as well as data from other sources as described in Chapter
          4. Notably, we have focused our analysis on a subset of possible climate hazards: lethal heat waves, heat and humidity and
          its impact on workability, water stress, riverine flooding, drought, and the impact of increased temperature and changes in
          precipitation on biome shifts. Analysis based on an RCP 8.5 scenario.

to define the impact of climate change, often building on the risk measures used in our case
studies, and choosing the best possible measures based on broad country coverage and data
availability. 32 For example, for livability and workability, we use the measures of the share of
population living in areas projected to experience a non-zero annual probability of lethal heat
waves as well as the annual share of effective outdoor working hours affected by extreme heat
and humidity in climate-exposed regions. This is similar to the approach followed in our India
case study.

We find that all 105 countries are expected to experience an increase in at least one major type
of impact on their stock of human, physical, and natural capital by 2030. Intensifying climate
hazards could put millions of lives at risk, as well as trillions of dollars of economic activity and
physical capital, and the world’s stock of natural capital. The intensification of climate hazards
across regions will bring areas hitherto unexposed to impacts into new risk territory.

— Livability and workability. By 2030, under an RCP 8.5 scenario, our research suggests
  that between 250 million and 360 million people could live in regions where there is a
  non-zero probability of a heat wave exceeding the threshold for survivability for a healthy
  human being in the shade (a measure of livability, without factoring in air conditioner
  penetration). 33 The average probability of a person living in an at-risk region experiencing
  such a lethal heat wave at least once over the decade centered on 2030 is estimated to
  be approximately 60 percent. 34 Some exposed regions will have a lower probability, and
  some regions higher. By 2050, the number of people living in regions exposed to such heat
  waves could rise further, to between 700 million and 1.2 billion, again without factoring in
  an adaptation response via air conditioner penetration. This reflects the fact that some of
  the most heavily populated areas of the world are usually also the hottest and most humid,
  and, as described below, these areas are becoming even hotter and more humid. Today, air
  conditioner penetration is roughly 10 percent across India, and roughly 60 percent across
  China. 35 The global average number of working hours that could be lost due to increasing
  heat and humidity in exposed regions (a measure of workability impacts) could almost
  double by 2050, from 10 percent to 15 to 20 percent. This is because more regions of the
  world are exposed, and the ones that are exposed would see higher intensity of heat and
  humidity effects. We used these projections to estimate the resulting GDP at risk from lost
  working hours. This could amount to $4 trillion to $6 trillion globally at risk by 2050 in an
  average year (Exhibit E10). This the equivalent of 2 to 3.5 percent of 2050 GDP, up from
  about 1.5 percent today. 36


32
      The indicators used in our geospatial analysis include: share of population that lives in areas experiencing a non-zero
      annual probability of lethal heat waves, annual share of effective outdoor working hours affected by extreme heat
      and humidity in climate exposed-regions, water stress as measured by the annual demand of water as a share of
      annual supply of water (these three are measures of livability and workability, and are considered in our India case and
      Mediterranean cases), annual share of capital stock at risk of flood damage in climate-exposed regions (asset destruction
      and infrastructure services; similar measures of capital stock damage are used in our Florida and Inundation cases),
      share of time spent in drought over a decade (measure of food systems; we also consider the impact of drought in our
      Mediterranean case), share of land surface changing climate classification annually (measure of natural capital; this was
      used for our geospatial analysis to allow us to develop a global measure of natural capital risk). Notably, drought is the one
      measure of hazard rather than risk used in this framework. This was done because of data limitations with obtaining data
      on impacts on agricultural yield by country, since the AgMIP climate models used to project agricultural yields tend only
      to be used for relatively large breadbasket regions, rather than at a country level. We are able to use the AgMIP results to
      provide global trends on breadbaskets and results pertaining to large breadbasket regions; however, such results were not
      included in the country-by-country analysis. We also excluded risk due to hazards like hurricanes, storm surge, and forest
      fires due to challenges obtaining sufficiently granular and robust data across countries. See Chapter 4 for details.
33
      Here, as before, lethal heat wave refers to a three-day period with average daily maximum wet-bulb temperatures
      exceeding 34 degrees Celsius. This temperature was chosen because urban areas with a high urban heat island effect
      could amplify 34°C ambient temperatures over the 35°C wet-bulb survivability threshold. These numbers are subject to
      uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cool island effects. If a non-
      zero probability of lethal heat waves in certain regions occurred in the models for today, this was set to zero to account
      for the poor representation of the high levels of observed atmospheric aerosols in those regions in the CMIP5 models.
      High levels of atmospheric aerosols provide a cooling effect that masks the risk. See India case for further details. This
      analysis excludes grid-cells where the the likelihood of lethal heat waves is <1 percent, to eliminate areas of low statistical
      significance. Additionally, these numbers assume no air-conditioning protection, and as such should be considered an
      upper bound. See Chapter 2 for details. Analysis based on an RCP 8.5 scenario.
34
      This calculation is a rough approximation. It assumes that the annual probability of roughly 9 percent applies to every year
      in the decade centered around 2030. We first calculate the cumulative probability of a heat wave not occurring in that
      decade, which is 91 percent raised to the power of 10. The cumulative probability of a heat wave occurring at least once in
      the decade is then 1 minus that number.

36
      The range here is based on the pace of sectoral transition across countries. GDP at risk will be higher if a greater portion of
      the economy is occupied in outdoor work. The lower end of the range assumes that today’s sectoral composition persists,
      while the higher end is based on projections from IHS Markit Economics and Country Risk on sectoral transitions.

  distribution of outdoor labor are held constant. For this analysis, outdoor labor is considered to include agriculture, construction, and mining and
  quarrying only, and knock-on impacts on other sectors are not considered. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050)
  states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in
  2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050 as average between 2041 and 2060.

— Food systems. Our research suggests an increase in global agricultural yield volatility
  that skews toward worse outcomes. For example, by 2050, the annual probability of a
  greater than 10 percent reduction in yields for wheat, corn, soy, and rice in a given year
  is projected to increase from 6 to 18 percent. 37 The annual probability of a greater than
  10 percent increase in yield in a given year is expected to rise from 1 percent to 6 percent.
  These trends are not uniform across countries and, importantly, some could see improved
  agricultural yields, while others could suffer negative impacts. For example, the average
  breadbasket region of Europe and Russia is expected to experience a 4 percent increase
  in average yields by 2050. While the annual probability of a greater than 10 percent yield
  failure there will increase, from 8 percent to 11 percent annually by 2050, the annual
  probability of a bumper year with a greater than 10 percent higher-than-average yield in
  the same period will increase by more, from 8 percent to 18 percent.

— Physical assets and infrastructure services. Assets can be destroyed or services from
  infrastructure assets disrupted from a variety of hazards, including flooding, forest fires,
  hurricanes, and heat. Statistically expected damage to capital stock from riverine flooding
  could double by 2030 from today’s levels and quadruple by 2050. Data availability has
  made it challenging to develop similar estimates for the much larger range of impacts from
  tidal flooding, fires, and storms. 38

— Natural capital. With temperature increases and precipitation changes, the biome
  in parts of the world is expected to shift. The biome refers to the naturally occurring
  community of flora and fauna inhabiting a particular region. For this report, we have used
  changes in the Köppen Climate Classification System as an indicative proxy for shifts in
  biome. 39 For example, tropical rainforests exist in a particular climatic envelope that is
  defined by temperature and precipitation characteristics. In many parts of the world, this
  envelope could begin to be displaced by a much drier “tropical Savannah” climate regime
  that threatens tropical rainforests. Today, about 25 percent of the Earth’s land area has
  already experienced a shift in climate classification compared with the 1901–25 period. By
  2050, that number is projected to increase to about 45 percent. Almost every country will
  see some risk of biome shift by 2050, affecting ecosystem services, local livelihoods, and
  species’ habitat.


Countries with the lowest per capita GDP levels are generally
more exposed
While all countries are affected by climate change, our research suggests that the poorest
countries are generally more exposed, as they often have climates closer to dangerous
physical thresholds. The patterns of this risk increase look different across countries. Broadly
speaking, countries can be divided into six groups based on their patterns of increasing risk
(Exhibits E11, E12, and E13). 40




37
     Global yields based on an analysis of six global breadbaskets that make up 70 percent of global production of four
     crops; wheat, soy, maize, and rice. Cumulative likelihood calculated for the decade centered on 2030 and 2050 by using
     annual probabilities for the climate state in the 2030 period, and the 2050 period respectively. Annual probabilities are
     independent and can therefore be aggregated to arrive at a cumulative decadal probability. Yield anomalies here are
     measured relative to the 1998-2017 average yield.
38
     See Chapter 4 for details.
39
     The Köppen climate system divides climates into five main climate groups with each group further subdivided based on
     seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns. This is not a perfect system for assessing the location and composition
     of biomes; however, these two characteristics do correlate very closely with climate classification, and therefore this was
     assessed as a reasonable proxy for risk of disruptive biome changes.
40
     These patterns were primarily based on looking at indicators relating to livability and workability, food systems, and
     natural capital. The annual share of capital stock at risk of riverine flood damage in climate-exposed regions indicator
     was considered but was not found to be the defining feature of any country grouping aside from a lower-risk group of
     countries.

1. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen
   because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects
   could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of
   atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.
2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
Note: See the Technical Appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

1. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen
   because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects
   could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of
   atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.
2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
Note: See the Technical Appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

4. Calculated assuming constant exposure. Constant exposure means that we do not factor in any increases in population or assets, or shifts in the
   spatial mix of population and assets. This was done to allow us to isolate the impact of climate change alone. Color coding for each column based
   on the spread observed across countries within the indicator.

— Significantly hotter and more humid countries. Hot and humid countries such as India
  and Pakistan are expected to become significantly hotter and more humid by 2050.
  Countries in this group are near the equator in Africa, Asia, and the Persian Gulf. They are
  characterized by extreme increases in heat and humidity impacts on workability, as well as
  a decrease in water stress. The potential livability impact that countries in this group face
  is projected to increase, because of the combination of heat and humidity.

— Hotter and more humid countries. This group includes the Philippines, Ethiopia, and
  Indonesia. These countries are typically between the equator and the 30-degree north
  and 30-degree south lines of latitude. They face a large potential increase in heat and
  humidity impacts on workability but may not become so hot or humid that they exceed
  livability thresholds. Water stress is also expected to decrease for these countries.

— Hotter countries. This group includes Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and
  Malaysia. Many countries in this group are near the equator. They are characterized by a
  large increase in heat and humidity impact on workability but are not expected to become
  so hot or humid that they pass livability thresholds. This group of countries is not expected
  to become wetter, and some of these countries could even become substantially drier and
  see increased water stress.

— Increased water stress countries. This group includes Egypt, Iran, and Mexico, which
  intersect the 30-degree north or south line of latitude. They are characterized by a large
  increase in water stress and drought frequency, and among the largest increases in biome
  change. In these locations, Hadley cells (the phenomenon responsible for the atmospheric
  transport of moisture from the tropics, and therefore location of the world’s deserts) are
  expanding, and these countries face a projected reduction in rainfall.

— Lower-risk increase countries. This group includes Germany, Russia, and the United
  Kingdom. Many countries in this group lie outside the 30-degree north and south lines
  of latitude and are generally cold countries. Some are expected to see a decrease in
  overall impact on many indicators. These countries are characterized by very low levels
  of heat and humidity impacts and many countries are expected to see decreases in water
  stress and time spent in drought. As these countries grow warmer, they will likely see the
  largest increase in biome change as the polar and boreal climates retreat poleward and
  disappear. The share of capital stock at risk of riverine flood damage in climate-exposed
  regions could also potentially increase in some of these countries.

— Diverse climate countries. The final group consists of countries that span a large range
  of latitudes and therefore are climatically heterogeneous. Examples include Argentina,
  Brazil, Chile, China, and the United States. 41 While average numbers may indicate small risk
  increases, these numbers mask wide regional variations. The United States, for example,
  has a hot and humid tropical climate in the Southeast, which will see dramatic increases
  in heat risk to outdoor work but is not projected to struggle with water scarcity. The West
  Coast region, however, will not see a big increase in heat risk to outdoor work, but will
  struggle with water scarcity and drought. In Alaska, the primary risk will be the shifting
  boreal biome and the attendant ecosystem disruptions.

The risk associated with the impact on workability from rising heat and humidity is one
example of how poorer countries could be more vulnerable to climate hazards (Exhibit E14).




41
     To some extent, many countries could experience diversity of risk within their boundaries. Here we have focused on
     highlighting countries with large climatic variations, and longitudinal expanse, which drives different outcomes in
     different parts of the country.

When looking at the workability indicator (that is, the share of outdoor working hours lost to
extreme heat and humidity), the top quartile of countries (based on GDP per capita) have an
average increase in risk by 2050 of approximately one to three percentage points, whereas
the bottom quartile faces an average increase in risk of about five to ten percentage points.
Lethal heat waves show less of a correlation with per capita GDP, but it is important to note
that several of the most affected countries—Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, to name a few—
have relatively low per capita GDP levels.

Conversely, biome shift is expected to affect northern and southern latitude countries. Since
many of these countries have higher per capita GDP levels, this indicator shows a positive
correlation with development levels.


Leaders will need to better understand the impacts of physical climate
risk, while accelerating adaptation and mitigation
In the face of these challenges, policy makers and business leaders will need to put in place
the right tools, analytics, processes, and governance to properly assess climate risk, adapt
to risk that is locked in, and decarbonize to reduce the further buildup of risk. In Box E3 that
concludes this summary, we present a range of questions that stakeholders could consider as
they look to manage risk.

Integrating climate risk into decision making
Much as thinking about information systems and cyber-risks has become integrated into
corporate and public-sector decision making, climate change will also need to feature as a
major factor in decisions. For companies, this will mean taking climate considerations into
account when looking at capital allocation, development of products or services, and supply
chain management, among others. For cities, a climate focus will become essential for urban
planning decisions. Financial institutions could consider the risk in their portfolios. 42 Moreover,
while this report has focused on physical risk, a comprehensive risk management strategy will
also need to include an assessment of transition and liability risk, and the interplay between
these forms of risk.

Developing a robust quantitative understanding is complex, for the many reasons outlined
in this report. It requires the use of new tools, metrics, and analytics. Companies and
communities are beginning to assess their exposure to climate risk, but much more needs
to be done. Lack of understanding significantly increases risks and potential impacts
across financial markets and socioeconomic systems, for example, by driving capital flows
to risky assets in risky geographies or increasing the likelihood of stakeholders being
caught unprepared.

At the same time, opportunities from a changing climate will emerge and require
consideration. These could arise from a change in the physical environment, such as new
places for agricultural production, or for sectors like tourism, as well as through the use of new
technologies and approaches to manage risk in a changing climate.

One of the biggest challenges could stem from using the wrong models to quantify risk.
These range from financial models used to make capital allocation decisions to engineering
models used to design structures. As we have discussed, there is uncertainty associated with
global and regional climate models, underlying assumptions on emissions paths, and, most
importantly, in translating climate hazards to potential physical and financial damages. While
these uncertainties are non-negligible, continued reliance on current models based on stable
historical climate and economic data presents an even higher “model risk.”

     Three examples of how models could be inappropriate for the changing climate are as follows:

     — Geography. Current models may not sufficiently take into account geospatial dimensions.
       As this report highlights, direct impacts of climate change are local in nature, requiring
       understanding exposure to risk via geospatial analysis. For example, companies will need
       to understand how their global asset footprint is exposed to different forms of climate
       hazard in each of their main locations and indeed in each of the main locations of their
       critical suppliers.

     — Non-stationarity. Given the constantly changing or non-stationary climate, assumptions
       based on historical precedent and experience will need to be rethought. That could
       include, for example, how resilient to make new factories, what tolerance levels to employ
       in new infrastructure, and how to design urban areas. Decisions will need to take into
       consideration that the climate will continue to change over the next several decades.

     — Sample bias. Decision makers often rely on their own experiences as a frame for
       decisions; in a changing climate, that can result in nonlinear effects and thus lead to
       incorrect assessments of future risk.

     Accelerating the pace and scale of adaptation
     Societies have been adapting to the changing climate, but the pace and scale of adaptation
     will likely need to increase significantly. Key adaptation measures include protecting people
     and assets, building resilience, reducing exposure, and ensuring that appropriate financing
     and insurance are in place.

     — Protecting people and assets. Measures to protect people and assets to the extent
       possible can help limit risk. Steps can range from prioritizing emergency response and
       preparedness to erecting cooling shelters and adjusting working hours for outdoor
       workers exposed to heat. Hardening existing infrastructure and assets is a key response.
       According to the UN Environment Programme, the cost of adaptation for developing
       countries may range from $140 billion to $300 billion a year by 2030. This could rise to
       $280 billion to $500 billion by 2050. 43 Hardening of infrastructure could include both
       “gray” infrastructure—for example, raising elevation levels of buildings in flood-prone
       areas—and natural capital or “green” infrastructure. One example of this is the Dutch
       Room for the River program, which gives rivers more room to manage higher water levels. 44
       Another example is mangrove plantations, which can provide storm protection.

          Factoring decisions about protection into new buildings will likely be more cost-
          effective than retrofitting. 45 For example, infrastructure systems or factories may be
          designed to withstand what used to be a 1-in-200‑year event. With a changing climate,
          what constitutes such an event may look different, and design parameters will need
          to be reassessed. Estimates suggest that $30 trillion to $50 trillion will be spent on
          infrastructure in the next ten years, much of it in developing countries. 46 Designing such
          infrastructure with climate risk in mind may help reduce downstream repair and rebuilding
          costs. Moreover, infrastructure that specifically helps protect assets and people will be
          needed, for example cooling technologies including green air-conditioning (high energy
          efficiency HVAC powered by low carbon power, for example), emergency shelters, and
          passive urban design.

— Building resilience. Asset hardening will need to go hand-in-hand with measures that
  make systems more resilient and robust in a world of rising climate hazard. Building global
  inventory to mitigate risks of food and raw material shortages is an example of resilience
  planning, leveraging times of surplus and low prices. To make the food system more
  resilient, private and public research could be expanded, for example on technology that
  aims to make crops more resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses. As noted, climate change
  challenges key assumptions that have been used to optimize supply chain operations
  in the past. Those assumptions may thus need to be rethought, for example by building
  backup inventory levels in supply chains to protect against interrupted production, as well
  as establishing the means to source from alternate locations and/or suppliers.

— Reducing exposure. In some instances, it may also be necessary to reduce exposure by
  relocating assets and communities in regions that may be too difficult to protect, that is,
  to retreat from certain areas or assets. Given the long lifetimes of many physical assets,
  the full life cycle will need to be considered and reflected in any adaptation strategy. For
  example, it may make sense to invest in asset hardening for the next decade but also
  to shorten asset life cycles. In subsequent decades, as climate hazards intensify and
  the cost-benefit equation of physical resilience measures is no longer attractive, it may
  become necessary to relocate and redesign asset footprints altogether.

— Insurance and finance. While insurance cannot eliminate the risk from a changing
  climate, it is a crucial shock absorber to help manage risk. 47 Insurance can help provide
  system resilience to recover more quickly from disasters and reduce knock-on effects. It
  can also encourage behavioral changes among stakeholders by sending appropriate risk
  signals—for example, to homeowners buying real estate, lenders providing loans, and real
  estate investors financing real estate build-out.

     Instruments such as parametrized insurance and catastrophe bonds can provide
     protection against climate events, minimizing financial damage and allowing speedy
     recovery after disasters. These products may help protect vulnerable populations that
     could otherwise find it challenging to afford to rebuild after disasters. Insurance can
     also be a tool to reduce exposure by transferring risk (for example, crop insurance allows
     transferring the risk of yield failure due to drought) and drive resilience (such as by
     enabling investments in irrigation and crop-management systems for rural populations
     who would otherwise be unable to afford this).

     However, as the climate changes, insurance might need to be further adapted to
     continue providing resilience and, in some cases, avoid potentially adding vulnerability
     to the system. For example, current levels of insurance premiums and levels of
     capitalization among insurers may well prove insufficient over time for the rising levels
     of risk; and the entire risk transfer process (from insured to insurer to reinsurer to
     governments as insurers of last resort) and each constituents’ ability to fulfil their role
     may need examination. Without changes in risk reduction, risk transfer, and premium
     financing or subsidies, some risk classes in certain areas may become harder to insure,
     widening the insurance gap that already exists in some parts of the world without
     government intervention.

     Innovative approaches will also likely be required to help bridge the underinsurance gap.
     Premiums are already sometimes subsidized—one example is flood insurance, which is
     often nationally provided and subsidized. Such support programs however might need
     to be carefully rethought to balance support to vulnerable stakeholders with allowing
     appropriate risk signals in the context of growing exposure and multiple knock-on
     effects. One answer might be providing voucher programs to help ensure affordability for
     vulnerable populations, while maintaining premiums at a level that reflects the appropriate

         risk. Trade-offs between private and public insurance, and for individuals, between
         when to self-insure or buy insurance, will need to be carefully evaluated. In addition,
         underwriting may need to shift to drive greater risk reduction in particularly vulnerable
         areas (for example, new building codes or rules around hours of working outside). This
         is analogous to fire codes that emerged in cities in order to make buildings insurable.
         Insurance may also need overcome a duration mismatch; for example, homeowners may
         expect long-term stability for their insurance premiums, whereas insurers may look to
         reprice annually in the event of growing hazards and damages. This could also apply to
         physical supply chains that are currently in place or are planned for the future, as the
         ability to insure them affordably may become a criterion of growing significance.

         Mobilizing finance to fund adaptation measures, particularly in developing countries, is
         also crucial. This may require public-private partnerships or participation by multilateral
         institutions, to prevent capital flight from risky areas once climate risk is appropriately
         recognized. Innovative products and ventures have been developed recently to broaden
         the reach and effectiveness of these measures. They include “wrapping” a municipal bond
         into a catastrophe bond, to allow investors to hold municipal debt without worrying about
         hard-to-assess climate risk. Governments of developing nations are increasingly looking
         to insurance/reinsurance carriers and other capital markets to improve their resiliency
         to natural disasters as well as give assurances to institutions that are considering
         investments in a particular region.

     — Addressing tough adaptation choices. Implementing adaptation measures could
       be challenging for many reasons. The economics of adaptation could worsen in some
       geographies over time, for example, those exposed to rising sea levels. Adaptation may
       face technical or other limits. In other instances, there could be hard trade-offs that need
       to be assessed, including who and what to protect and who and what to relocate. For
       example, the impact on individual home owners and communities needs to be weighed
       against the rising burden of repair costs and post-disaster aid, which affects all taxpayers.

         Individual action will likely not be sufficient in many interventions; rather, coordinated
         action bringing together multiple stakeholders could be needed to promote and enable
         adaptation. This may include establishing building codes and zoning regulations,
         mandating insurance or disclosures, mobilizing capital through risk-sharing mechanisms,
         sharing best practices within and across industry groups, and driving innovation.
         Integrating diverse perspectives including those of different generations into decision
         making will help build consensus.

Decarbonizing at scale
An assessment and roadmap for decarbonization is beyond the scope of this report. However,
climate science and research by others tell us that the next decade will be decisive not only
to adapt to higher temperatures already locked in but also to prevent further buildup of risk
through decarbonization at scale. 48 Stabilizing warming (and thus further buildup of risk) will
require reaching net-zero emissions, meaning taking carbon out of future economic activity
to the extent possible, as well as removing existing CO2 from the atmosphere to offset any
residual hard-to-abate emissions (that is, achieving negative emissions). 49 An important
consideration in this context is that climate science also tells us a number of feedback loops
are present in the climate system, such as the melting of Arctic permafrost, which would
release significant amounts of greenhouse gases. If activated, such feedback loops could
cause significant further warming, possibly pushing the Earth into a “hot house” state.50
Scientists estimate that restricting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius would reduce the
risk of initiating many of the serious feedback loops, while further restricting warming to
1.5 degrees Celsius would reduce the risk of initiating most of them. 51 Because warming is
a function of cumulative emissions, there is a specific amount of CO2 that can be emitted
before we are expected to reach the 1.5- or 2-degree Celsius thresholds (a “carbon budget”).52
Scientists estimate that the remaining 2-degree carbon budget of about 1,000 GtCO2 will
be exceeded in approximately 25 years given current annual emissions of about 40 GtCO2. 53
Similarly, the remaining 1.5-degree carbon budget is about 480 GtCO2, equivalent to about
12 years of current annual emissions. Hence, prudent risk management would suggest
aggressively limiting future cumulative emissions to minimize the risk of activating these
feedback loops. While decarbonization is not the focus of this research, decarbonization
investments will need to be considered in parallel with adaptation investments, particularly
in the transition to renewable energy. Stakeholders should consider assessing their
decarbonization potential and opportunities from decarbonization.

1. Understanding
   physical climate risk
  A changing climate is introducing new risks that are significant today and will grow. These
  risks can be grouped into three types: physical risk (risks arising from the physical effects of
  climate change); transition risk (risks arising from transition to a low-carbon economy); and
  liability risk (risks arising from those affected by climate change seeking compensation for
  losses). 54 While some regions and sector could benefit, this report assesses the physical risk
  from a changing climate, including the potential effects on people, communities, natural and
  physical capital, and economic activity, and the implications for companies, governments,
  financial institutions, and individuals. We do not focus on transition risks or liability risks
  associated with climate change. While decarbonization and the risks and opportunities it
  creates is a critical topic, this report contributes by exploring the nature and costs of ongoing
  climate change in the absence of decarbonization.

  Physical climate risks are probabilistic because of the probabilistic nature of the underlying
  climate hazards that create risk; for example, there is a certain likelihood associated with
  having floods of a given severity, or days above a certain temperature, in a year. By hazards,
  we mean climate-induced physical phenomena (acute or chronic) that have the potential to
  impact natural and socioeconomic systems. A changing climate means these likelihoods
  are shifting. We consider the “inherent” level of risk that results from these shifts —that is,
  the risk before consideration of adaptation and mitigation measures that could reduce the
  likelihood or magnitude of socioeconomic impacts—as well as the potential adaptation and
  mitigation response. We believe this approach is appropriate to help stakeholders understand
  the potential magnitude of the impacts from climate change and the commensurate response
  required. We look at two periods: between today and 2030, and from 2030 to 2050.

  To develop meaningful local estimates of physical climate risk, we draw on climate models
  to understand how geospatially specific climate hazards could evolve under an RCP
  8.5 scenario. We then create a taxonomy for physical risk by examining the impact of those
  hazards on five critical socioeconomic systems. They are: livability and workability, food
  systems, physical assets, infrastructure services, and natural capital. Together, these
  represent impacts on human beings, human-made physical assets, and the natural world.
  For each type of system, we assess impact by examining nine cases across sectors and
  geographies that were chosen based on their exposure to the extremes of climate change
  and their proximity today to key physical and biological thresholds. As such, they represent
  leading-edge examples of climate change. In a separate analysis, we use geospatial data to
  provide a perspective on physical climate risk across 105 countries over the next 30 years,
  using the same five-systems framework of direct impacts. Details of our modeling are
  described in the executive summary, Chapter 4, and the technical appendix.

     Our intent is not to provide point forecasts. Climate is the statistical summary of weather
     patterns over time and is therefore probabilistic in nature. Following standard practice, our
     findings are therefore framed as “statistically expected values”—the statistically expected
     average impact across a range of probabilities of different hazard manifestations. We also
     report the value of “tail risks”—that is, low-probability, high-impact events like a 1-in-100‑year
     storm—on an annual basis. In some cases, we show the cumulative probability of a tail
     risk over a period. Consider for example a flooding event that has a 1 percent likelihood
     of occurrence every year (often described as a “100‑year flood”). In the lifetime of home
     ownership, the cumulative likelihood that the home will experience at least one 100‑year flood
     is 26 percent. 55 Understanding such cumulative probabilities is important for stakeholders
     looking to design appropriate risk-management strategies.


     A five-systems framework for measuring potential direct and indirect
     impacts of the changing climate
     We measure the impact of climate change by the extent to which it could disrupt or destroy
     stocks of capital—human, physical, and natural—and the resultant socioeconomic impact of
     that disruption or destruction. As climate hazards manifest, they can affect these systems
     and thus create risk. For example, flooding in a particular location could damage a physical
     structure like a factory. To provide a framework for our analysis, we conducted an extensive
     review of direct impacts and classified them into five groups of system directly affected by
     physical climate hazards. The five are livability and workability, food systems, physical assets,
     infrastructure services, and natural capital. This five-systems impact framework is our best
     effort to capture the entire range of potential impacts from physical climate hazards. In the
     course of our work, we have not identified any other material impacts of climate change
     outside these five groups. We define each of the five as follows:

     — Livability and workability. Livability refers to the ability of an area to sustain human life
       and activity; workability is the capacity to engage in outdoor work. Hazards like heat
       stress and flooding could affect the ability of human beings to work outdoors or put
       human lives at risk. Heat reduces labor capacity because workers must take breaks to
       avoid heatstroke and because the body naturally limits its efforts in order to prevent
       over-exertion. Increased temperatures could also shift disease vectors and thus affect
       human health.

     — Food systems. Food systems include the production and distribution of agricultural
       products and the associated revenues and livelihoods. Food production could be
       disrupted as drought conditions, extreme temperatures, or floods affect land and
       crops. Conversely, some climatic shifts could also make some regions more suitable
       for agriculture. A changing climate change can both improve and degrade food system
       performance, while introducing more or less volatility. In some cases, crop yields may
       increase; in other cases, thresholds could be exceeded beyond which some crops
       fail entirely.

     — Physical assets. Physical assets like buildings could be damaged or destroyed by
       extreme precipitation, tidal flooding, forest fires, and other hazards. Hazards could even
       materially impact an entire network of assets such as a city’s central business district.

     — Infrastructure services. Infrastructure assets are a particular type of physical asset
       that could be destroyed in their functioning, leading to a decline in the services they
       provide or a rise in the cost of these services. For example, power systems could become
       less productive under very hot conditions. A range of hazards including heat, wind, and
       precipitation can disrupt infrastructure services. This in turn can have knock-on effects on
       other sectors.

— Natural capital. Climate change is shifting ecosystems and destroying forms of natural
  capital such as glaciers, forests, and ocean ecosystems, which provide important
  services to humans. Natural capital is at risk from both acute hazards like wildfires and
  chronic hazards like rising temperatures. These impacts are hard to model but could be
  nonlinear and in some cases—such as glacier melting—irreversible. In some cases, human
  mismanagement may play a role, for example with forest fires and water scarcity, but the
  effect of this mismanagement is multiplied by climate change.

To assess the magnitude of direct physical climate risk in each case and for our geospatial
analysis, we examine the severity of the hazard and its likelihood; the exposure of people,
assets, or economic activity to the hazard; and the extent to which systems are vulnerable
to the hazard, for example, how vulnerable buildings are to damage from different depths of
flood. Direct impacts could have knock-on effects. For example, flood damage to a factory
could interrupt production and affect downstream players in a supply chain.


How our methodology addresses possible sources of uncertainty
One of the main challenges in understanding the physical risk arising from climate change is
the range of uncertainties involved. Yet a key insight of this research has been that, despite
the many uncertainties associated with estimations of impact from a changing climate, it is
possible for the science and socioeconomic analyses and methodologies presented here
to provide actionable insights. In this chapter, we outline some of these uncertainties and
our approach to addressing them. It is important for decision makers to understand these
uncertainties and incorporate that understanding into a risk-management approach that
aligns with their risk appetite.

Here, we highlight the possible sources of uncertainty and our methodological approach to
addressing these in this report. The discussion below relates both to the results from our case
studies and from our geospatial analysis. Risks arise as a result of an involved causal chain:
Emissions influence both global climate as well as regional climate variations, which in turn
influence the frequency and severity of specific climate hazards (such as droughts and sea-
level rise), which then influence the frequency and severity of physical damage (such as crop
shortage and infrastructure damages), which finally influence broader economic, social and
financial harm. Our analysis, like any such effort, relies on assumptions made along the causal
chain: about emission paths and adaptation schemes; global and regional climate models;
physical damage functions; and knock-on effects. The further one goes along the chain, the
greater the intrinsic model uncertainty.

The key uncertainties include: emissions pathways and the pace of warming; climate model
accuracy and natural variability; the magnitude of direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts,
given a certain hazard; and the socioeconomic response.

Emissions pathways and pace of warming
Climate impact research has inherent uncertainties and as a result makes extensive use
of scenarios. One particular input around which scenarios are frequently constructed is
atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Projections of future climate must be based upon an
assumed trajectory for future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Because future
human emissions of greenhouse gases are inherently unpredictable, the climate community
has developed a set of four standardized scenarios for future atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). 56 They outline
different atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration trajectories between 2005 and
2100 that roughly range from lower (RCP2.6) to higher (RCP 8.5) CO2 concentrations. During
their inception, RCPs were designed to collectively sample the range of then-probable future
emission pathways. Each RCP was created by an independent modeling team and there is

     no consistent design of the socioeconomic parameter assumptions used in the derivation of
     the RCPs.

     Uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emissions is a key contributor to long-term (for
     example, end-of-century) uncertainty in future temperatures but is less important on the
     shorter time horizons (out to 2050) considered in this report. As we discuss in detail in
     Chapter 2, warming during the next decade is determined largely by past emissions and by
     physical inertia in the climate system. Beyond the next decade, warming is primarily a function
     of cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Because decarbonization takes time, even a
     scenario of targeted decarbonization action will result in significant cumulative emissions over
     the next three decades. Climate simulations driven by the four RCP scenarios show a small
     divergence in warming over the next two decades, and a moderate divergence by 2050 (see
     also Exhibit 1, which shows projected warming for RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5; the two RCPs that
     are most commonly used in climate models, to provide a sense of the spread in scenarios).57

     We rely on RCP 8.5 for the analyses in this report. RCP 8.5 was created to model a case of no
     further climate action and relatively higher rates of baseline greenhouse gas emissions. We
     have chosen to focus on RCP 8.5, because the higher-emission scenario it portrays enables
     us to assess physical risk in the absence of further decarbonization.

     While RCP 8.5 has been criticized for assuming unrealistically high use of coal and thus
     projecting too-high emissions in the second half of the century, we only consider a timeframe
     out to 2050, and we adopted RCP 8.5 as a best available description for an ‘inherent risk’
     scenario over the next two to three decades. 58

     This assessment was also made for the following reasons.

     — Since the starting point of the RCPs in 2005, RCP 8.5 has most closely tracked actual
       greenhouse gas emissions (and going forward, RCP 8.5 is broadly consistent with a
       continuation of the emissions trend of the last decade). 59 As a result, it best matches
       current CO2 concentrations, whereas the other RCPs assume lower CO2 concentrations
       than observed.

     — Changes in the relative cost of renewable and fossil energy sources are forecast to
       lead to a moderate downward divergence from the historic trendline of energy-related
       CO2 emissions over the coming decades, even in absence of further decarbonization
       policies.60 In contrast, emissions from biotic feedbacks, such as permafrost thaw or
       increasing wildfires, are expected to increase. These feedbacks are not considered in
       the current generation of CMIP5 models and need to be accounted for exogenously.
       According to a recent review of the literature on biotic feedbacks, in the near term these
       feedbacks are estimated to reduce the 1.5 degree Celsius carbon budget by 100 GtCO2,
       and 2 degree Celsius carbon budget by 150 GtCO2. 61

— Early results from the next generation of climate models, CMIP6, suggest that the climate
  system may be more sensitive to CO2 than the current generation of models (CMIP5) used
  here, suggesting that the CMIP5 models may tend to underestimate future warming.62

Based upon these considerations we chose to employ RCP 8.5 as a base case for considering
2030 to 2050. Were this study investigating the risk outlook for 2100, we would consider
multiple emissions pathways, but for the next three decades, we consider RCP 8.5 to be the
best guide for understanding inherent risk.

Restricting warming to below two degrees, the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement, would
mean reaching net-zero emissions in the next 40 to 50 years. If this were achieved, the impact
estimates presented in this report would likely not manifest to their full extent. Alternately,
a decarbonization approach somewhere between business-as-usual and a two-degree-
compliant pathway would mean that temperatures in 2050 would be below the roughly
2 degrees Celsius increase reflected in the RCP 8.5 scenario, but that such temperature
increases would be reached at some point post-2050. This means that the impact
assessments presented in this report would manifest but only after 2050; it would push the
2050 impacts further back into the second half of the century but would not prevent them.

Another way to frame this would be that if we were to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius,
our 2050 impact estimates would be the most severe impacts we would be expected to
see (but at some point after 2050), and if we were to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,
correspondingly our 2030 impact estimates would be the most severe impacts we would be
expected to see (but at some point after 2030). For example, RCP 8.5 predicts global average
warming of 2.3 degrees Celsius by 2050, compared with 1.8 for RCP 4.5. Under RCP 4.5,
2.3 degrees Celsius warming would be reached in the year 2080.63

Climate model accuracy
This refers to modeling uncertainty associated with climate models that translate greenhouse
gas emissions into temperature increases and effects on other hazards, both globally and
in specific regions. While uncertainty is inherent in any model, scientists have tested the
ensemble of climate models used in this report against both observations and paleoclimate
records, and as a result have confidence in their probabilistic predictions of how climate
hazards will evolve over the next decades, given a particular emissions pathway.64 To reduce
model error, this report uses the mean or median projection of an ensemble of models,
depending on the requirements of the specific analysis.65 This approach has been found
to generate a more robust projection than any individual model.66 It is important to note
that, when looking across a full range of climate science models, the uncertainty in global
temperatures tends to skew primarily toward worse rather than better outcomes (Exhibit 1).

                                     Under RCP 8.5, for example, Earth is projected to warm by an estimated 2.3 degrees Celsius,
                                     +0.5 / –0.3 degree, by 2050.67 This spread is primarily due to uncertainty surrounding
                                     the strength of modeled fast-acting, non-carbon feedback mechanisms (for example,
                                     the way clouds respond to a warming planet), which amplify warming from greenhouse

                                     gases. Different models make different assumptions about the strength of these feedback

Modeling climate changes at a regional level introduces additional sources of uncertainty.
Because global climate models are generally spatially coarse, on the order of 100 by
100 kilometers, they are unable to resolve, or simulate, small geographical, atmospheric,
or biological features that exert significant influence over local climates. The global climate
system can also distribute additional heat in multiple different ways, and so the same
emissions scenario can result in different regional warming outcomes.70 Some of this
uncertainty can be reduced through technical methods (for example, the use of historical
regional data to calibrate global climate models), and some cannot.71 To make “skillful”
regional predictions requires careful choices of the specific modeling tool, climatic variable
of interest, region, and time period.72 The analyses in this study have been designed in such a
way as to minimize uncertainty from regional natural variability (through region, time period,
and variable choice), as well as to minimize uncertainty from model error (through technical
methods).73 For more details, see the technical appendix.

Natural variability
Natural variability is another consideration influencing how hazards could evolve. It refers to
climatic changes that occur independently of changes in the amount of energy trapped in the
Earth system. Natural variability arises primarily from multiyear patterns in ocean circulation
that can temporarily warm or cool the surface of the planet. These changes are included
in climate models, but because of their stochastic, or random, nature, their timing cannot
be accurately projected.74 One example is the El Niño / La Niña oscillation. Another is the
so-called global warming hiatus between 1998 and 2012, during which the global average
temperature did not seem to increase as much as climate models projected, as warming of
the planet’s surface was masked by changes in ocean heat uptake.75 The presence of natural
variability introduces uncertainty into our projections because it can temporarily accelerate
or delay the manifestation of longer-term statistical climate shifts.76 This uncertainty will be
particularly important over the next decade, during which overall climatic shifts relative to
today may be smaller in magnitude than a potential acceleration or delay in warming due to
natural variability.77

Direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts
To measure direct impact as hazards manifest, we have relied on publicly available
vulnerability assessments or “damage functions” for this but note that they may not accurately
represent the vulnerability of a specific asset or location. Another factor that could create
uncertainty is the magnitude of exposure to climate hazards. If more people or assets are
located in regions that are exposed to climate hazards, impacts could be higher. For this
report, we assume that exposure is constant for instances where we do not expect significant
shifts in exposure—for example, when we consider breadbasket failures, we do not assume
significant shifts in where crops are grown today. In other instances, we do consider changes
in exposure, such as sectoral shifts out of agriculture and manufacturing in the case of the

     impact of heat on India. We also consider increased infrastructure buildup when we look at
     the impact of flooding on cities in developing countries.

     Finally, there is uncertainty related to the indirect, or knock-on, impacts of a changing climate.
     Given the complexity of socioeconomic systems, we know that our case results do not capture
     the full impact of climate change. Socioeconomic systems are dynamic, with many interacting
     and interdependent elements. As is typical for such systems, changes in one element can
     have nonlinear repercussions on other elements and lead to unexpected phenomena.
     Assessing possible social or political knock-on effects from phenomena like lethal heat
     waves, for example, is difficult, and we have almost certainly not identified the full range
     of knock-on effects (see Box 1, “Three channels through which climate risk could trigger
     disruption in extreme cases”). Even in instances where we have identified knock-on effects,
     sizing the magnitude of potential impact in a given case—for example, the degree to which
     real estate valuations in Florida could change and when—is difficult. In many cases, we have
     relied either on past trends and empirical estimates of knock-on effects or discussed them in
     a qualitative manner alone.

     Socioeconomic response
     How much risk manifests also depends on the robustness of the response to the risk that is
     forecast. Adaptation measures such as hardening physical infrastructure, relocating people
     and assets, and ensuring backup capacity, among others, can help manage the impact of
     climate hazards and reduce risk. We therefore follow an approach that first assesses the
     inherent risk and then considers a potential adaptation response. We have not conducted a
     detailed bottom-up cost-benefit analysis of adaptation measures but have built on existing
     literature and expert interviews to understand the most important measures and their
     indicative cost, effectiveness, and implementation challenges in each of our cases, and
     to estimate the expected global adaptation spending required. While we note the critical
     importance of decarbonization in an appropriate climate risk management approach, a
     detailed road map for decarbonization is beyond the scope of this report.




     We conclude that despite many uncertainties that need to be reflected in decision making,
     climate science and the socioeconomic analyses and methodologies presented here can
     provide actionable insights for decision makers. Uncertainties tend to be skewed toward
     larger rather than smaller impact. How decision makers incorporate these uncertainties into
     their management choices will depend on their risk appetite and overall risk management
     approach. Some may want to work with the outcome considered most likely (which is what
     we generally considered with our analysis of “statistically expected outcomes”), while others
     may want to consider a worse- or even worst-case scenario. Given the complexities we have
     outlined above, we recognize that more research is needed in this critical field.

Box 1
Three channels through which physical climate risk could trigger
disruption in extreme cases

As physical climate risk spreads beyond local economies, it could trigger broader economic,
financial, social, and political disruption. While the likelihood and potential magnitude of such
disruption is impossible to predict, it could occur through several channels, including the
following three.

First, physical risks—and the anticipation thereof—which may prompt an abrupt policy
response. Sudden regulatory responses to rising climate hazards, for example following a
series of natural disasters or a marked change in political priorities, could destabilize markets
and companies. Such an abrupt transition would leave companies across the world with
assets that could become too expensive or even impossible to operate. This could in turn lead
to a range of knock-on effects for the owners of the asset, their ability to finance other assets,
and creditworthiness.

Second, sudden asset repricing and capital reallocation. Financial markets could experience
a devaluation due to an abrupt repricing of assets or a loss of access to long-term capital.
Such a climate “Minsky moment” might occur if a significant number of market participants
were to come to believe they have not adequately factored in physical climate risks which
could lead to a sudden depreciation of, for example, real estate prices.1 Knock-on financial
effects could then result from such a depreciation of collateral depending on the degree of
leverage, complexity (securitization and pooling), and transparency around the financing of
those assets. As an example, significant storm surge losses from hurricanes hitting coastal
real estate could lead to a substantial rise in insurance premiums, followed by an abrupt
devaluation of that real estate market, which in turn might lead investors to reappraise
their investments in other coastal real estate markets. A recognition by capital markets of
projected hazards and possible impacts over the coming decades could also lead to changes
in the cost or availability of long-term capital for certain sectors or regions and to changes in
credit ratings, disclosure, and regulations which could have the potential of creating a period
of heightened uncertainty and illiquidity until ratings, information, and regulation meet the
new market expectations. Unlike other financial sector booms and busts, the downside risk
in climate change-driven depreciation would likely not be cyclical—it would reflect higher
long-lasting, structural risks in particular geographies or sectors—hence requiring structural
responses. A swing from not considering climate risk to extreme caution in climate-sensitive
assets is a real concern.

Third, disruptive relocation of population and assets. Severe climate change effects could
trigger migration, social and political unrest, and potentially even conflict in affected
regions, which in turn may have global repercussions. Between 2008 and 2018, natural
disasters displaced as many as 265 million people, according to the Internal Displacement
Monitoring Centre.2 The World Bank projects that by 2050, in Latin America, South Asia, and
sub-Saharan Africa, climate change may cause about 140 million people to migrate within
their countries, away from areas with lower water availability and crop productivity or rising
sea level and storm surges. 3 While climate change is often not the sole factor in migration
decisions, it may amplify existing motivations such as poverty, war, and strife. As early as
2014, the US Department of Defense identified climate change as a “threat multiplier” and
“accelerant of instability.”4

2. A changing climate
   and resulting
   physical risk
  A changing climate requires us to assess the impact of physical climate risk over time horizons
  relevant for decision makers today. Energy trapped by increasing atmospheric greenhouse
  gases leads to rising temperatures, which in turn intensifies chronic climate hazards and
  increases the frequency and or severity of acute events. These developments have an
  impact on socioeconomic systems around the world. Looking ahead, climate science tells us
  that additional warming is locked in for the next decade, regardless of mitigation measures
  that may be adopted. Beyond the next decade, further warming will occur as a function of
  cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide. Climate science
  tells us that further warming and risk increase can only be stopped by achieving zero net
  greenhouse gas emissions. As the Earth continues to warm, climate science finds that
  physical climate hazards will intensify.


  Earth’s climate is warming and climate hazards are intensifying
  During the past 2.6 million years or so of Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history, the planet oscillated
  between long cooling, or glacial, periods during which large ice sheets covered as much as
  one-third of the planet’s surface, and short warming, or interglacial, periods when the climate
  was more temperate for, typically, 10,000 to 30,000 years. For approximately the past
  12,000 years, Earth has been in an interglacial period, characterized by a relatively stable,
  temperate climate. During this time, human civilization developed. Roughly 10,000 years ago,
  relatively soon after the climate stabilized, humans made the shift from hunter-gatherers to
  farmers (Exhibit 2).

  Modern society was built during this time of stable climate, which shaped the world in three
  fundamental ways. First, it produced a habitable planet, allowing humans to spread across the
  world. Second, it shaped the design of physiological, human-made and ecological systems
  that are optimized for historical local climate parameters. For example, the choice of which
  crops to grow where and the engineering design standards used for infrastructure are both
  based on temperature and precipitation levels from this stable past. Third, the stable climate
  created a predictable physical environment, which contributed to the emergence of the
  modern economy. Much of the economic and financial activity, particularly for the long-term—
  including buying, selling, investing, borrowing, and lending—requires a degree of confidence
  that tomorrow will be similar to today.

                                      This is now changing. The average combined global land-and-sea-surface temperature has
                                      increased by 1.1 +/– 0.05 degrees Celsius since 1880 (Exhibit 3).78 This has been confirmed
                                      by both satellite measurements and the analysis of hundreds of thousands of independent
                                      weather station observations from across the globe. The rapid decline in the planet’s surface
                                      ice cover provides further evidence. Earth is warming at a rate of about 0.2 degree Celsius
                                      per decade and losing Arctic sea ice at roughly 3,000 cubic kilometers per decade.79 This
                                      rate of warming is at least an order of magnitude faster than any currently identified in the
                                      past 65 million years of paleoclimate records and could be unprecedented as far back as
                                      250 million years. 80

   land and sea] for all days in a given year).
2. Periodicity in the data is because sea ice volume follows a periodic cycle with the Earth’s seasonal cycle: sea ice traditionally reaches annual low
   volumes in September and maximum volumes in late Northern Hemisphere spring.

                                      With this warming, historically rare events are becoming increasingly common. Global averages
                                      mask how the extreme end of the temperature distribution in a given region is changing. In
                                      statistical terms, distributions of temperature are shifting to the right and broadening. That means
                                      the average day in many locations is now hotter (“means shifting”), and extremely hot days are
                                      becoming more likely (“tails fattening”). For example, the evolution of the distribution of observed
                                      average summer temperatures for each 100-by-100-kilometer square in the Northern Hemisphere
                                      shows that the mean summer temperature has increased over time (Exhibit 4). The percentage
                                      of the Northern Hemisphere (in square kilometers) that experiences a substantially warmer
                                      summer—a two-standard-deviation warmer average temperature in a given year—has increased by
                                      more than 15 times, from less than 1 percent to approximately 15 percent. The share of the Northern
                                      Hemisphere (in square kilometers) that experiences an extremely warm summer—three-standard-
                                      deviation warmer average temperature in a given summer—went from zero percent to half a percent
                                      between 1980 and 2015. In other words, observations show unusually warm summers becoming
                                      more common across a greater percentage of the Northern Hemisphere, while summers so hot they
                                      have not occurred before in human temperature records have now become possible.

Averages also conceal wide spatial disparities. Over the same period that the Earth warmed
by 1.1 degrees Celsius, in southern parts of Africa and the Arctic, average temperatures
have risen by 0.2 to 0.5 degree and by 4 to 4.3 degrees, respectively. 81 In general, the land
surface has warmed faster than the 1.1-degree global average, and the oceans, which have a
higher heat capacity, have warmed less. As average temperatures rise, acute hazards such
as heat waves, extreme precipitation, and forest fires grow in frequency and or severity,
and chronic hazards such as drought and rising sea levels intensify. 82 Hotter summers and
warmer winters change frequency and volume of precipitation, increasing risks of severe
drought and extreme flooding. Rising temperatures also cause sea-level rise via the thermal
expansion of water and melting of land ice, as well as increasing tropical storm severity and
the risk of forest fires. 83 Some of these hazard-specific trends are already identifiable. For
example: since 1950, increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves have already
been positively identified in Asia, Australia, and Europe. Increases in frequency and severity
of extreme precipitation events have been identified in North America. Increases in drought
frequency and severity have been identified in the Mediterranean and West Africa, while
decreases have been identified in central North America. 84


A changing climate affects socioeconomic systems
Climate change is already having an impact on human, physical, and natural systems. Across
the world, we find examples of these impacts across each system in our five-systems
framework (Exhibit 5). Researchers have found that in each case climate change intensified
the natural hazard or increased its likelihood. For example:

— Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on August 25, 2017, caused about
  $125 billion in damage and shut down economic activity for weeks, including about
  20 percent of US crude oil refining capacity and a similar share of production in the Gulf
  of Mexico. Research suggests that the hurricane precipitation was about 8 to 19 percent
  more intense because of climate change. 85

— Recent floods in Asia provide another example of economic damage. The 2017 Hunan
  province floods affected 7.8 million people and resulted in $3.55 billion of direct economic
  loss, including severe infrastructure damage. Researchers estimate that climate change
  made the floods twice as likely. 86

— The July 2019 heat wave in Europe exceeded 37.5 degrees Celsius across the United
  Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Belgium, taking a toll on
  the region’s physical infrastructure, such as rail, roads, and power. This led to noticeable
  delays in transportation and to power outages. Economic activity slowed as small
  businesses and restaurants without air-conditioning closed. 87 Climate change made this
  heat wave approximately 10 times more likely in France, according to academic research. 88

     By hazards, we mean climate-induced physical events that have the potential to impact natural and socioeconomic
     systems.
83
     Predictions of how Earth is likely to respond to further greenhouse gas emissions are drawn primarily from climate
     models: computer simulations based on our understanding of physical laws and observations, laboratory experiments,
     and investigations into the past. These models simulate the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and in some cases
     biosphere at resolutions down to tens of kilometers. They have proved successful at replicating past climates and at
     predicting more recent global and regional changes. Using those tools, it is possible to identify how climate hazards are
     likely to change by 2030 and 2050 around the world and to translate that to potential socioeconomic impact. See the
     technical appendix for more details.

Warming of the Earth is “locked in” over the next decade, and further
warming will continue until net-zero emissions are reached
The primary driver of the observed rate of temperature increase over the past two centuries
is the human-caused rise in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse
gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. 89 Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
in the mid-18th century, humans have released nearly 2.5 trillion tonnes of CO2 into the
atmosphere, raising atmospheric CO2 concentrations from about 280 parts per million by
volume (ppmv) to 415 ppmv. Other greenhouse gas concentrations have similarly increased
due to human activity.90 Scientists know that changes in atmospheric concentrations of
CO2 and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the observed increase in temperature
because they have measured the magnitude of the three other drivers that have changed the
state of Earth’s climate in the past. These are incoming energy from the sun; Earth’s albedo
or “reflectivity”; and changes in other atmospheric constituents. They have found that only
the influence of greenhouse gases is significant enough to explain observed temperature
changes and patterns over the past 200 years.91 In February 2019, scientists confirmed
this finding to a five-sigma level of statistical significance; in other words, they estimate the
chance that natural variability of the climate system could have caused the observed pattern
and magnitude of global temperature increase at 1 in 3.5 million.92

Carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. As a result, nearly all of
the warming that occurs will be permanent on societally relevant timescales in the absence
of large-scale human action to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.93 Because of the strong
thermal inertia of the ocean, more warming is likely already locked in over the next decade,
regardless of emissions pathway.94

The future of Earth’s climate after the next decade is dependent on the cumulative amount of
long-lived greenhouse gases that humans emit. That means the planet will continue to warm
until net-zero emissions are reached.95 Furthermore, given the thermal inertia of the earth
system, some amount of warming will also likely occur after net-zero emissions are reached.



89
     Between 98 and 100 percent of observed warming since 1850 is attributable to the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas
     concentrations, and approximately 75 percent is attributable to CO2 directly. The remaining warming is caused by short-
     lived greenhouse gases like methane and black carbon, which, because they decay in the atmosphere, warm the planet
     as a function of rate (or flow) of emissions, not cumulative stock of emissions. Karsten Haustein et al., “A real-time Global

     Volume 110, Number C9. Note: it is possible to “reverse” a small portion of accrued warming by reducing the emission
     rates of short-lived climate pollutants like methane. Because methane decays in the atmosphere over a relatively short
     time, emission rates rather than stocks determine the contribution to experienced warming. Whereas reducing CO2
     emissions rates by 20 percent only slows the rate of warming, reducing CH4 emission rates by 20 percent actually
     reduces observed warming as “excess” methane is scrubbed from the atmosphere naturally over time.

     Net-zero emissions refers to a state in which total addition of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, on an annual basis,
     are zero, either because all emitting activities have ceased, all emitting technologies have been replaced with zero-
     emissions technology, or remaining emissions are balanced by an equal quantity of negative emissions (for example,
     removing greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere). For an overview of the amount of locked-in warming (called the
     Zero Emissions Commitment, or ZEC), the mechanics of climate stabilization, net-zero emissions, and carbon budgets,

Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                                          55


     Climate models show a growing level of physical hazard globally
     With increases in greenhouse gases, climate models project a rise in climate hazards globally.
     According to climate science, further warming will continue to increase the frequency and/or
     severity of acute climate hazards and intensify chronic hazards.

     Here, we describe the prediction of climate models for a selection of hazards under the
     RCP 8.5 scenario. The results have been drawn from WHRC analysis and publicly available
     data for a selection of other hazards (Exhibits 6 and 7).96 This list of climate hazards is
     illustrative rather than exhaustive. Due to data and modeling constraints, we did not include
     the following hazards: increased frequency and severity of forest fires, increased ranges for
     biological and ecological pests and diseases, increased severity of hurricane storm surge,
     and more frequent and severe flooding due to factors other than precipitation, for example
     sea-level rise or rapid snowpack or glacier melt.

     — Increase in average temperatures.97 As discussed in Chapter 1, global average
       temperatures are expected to increase over the next three decades, resulting in a
       2.3-degree Celsius increase in global average temperature relative to the preindustrial
       period by 2050, under an RCP 8.5 scenario. Depending on the exact location, this can
       translate to an average local temperature increase of between 1.5 and 5 degrees Celsius
       relative to today. Areas like the Arctic in particular are expected to become much warmer.

     — Extreme precipitation.98 In parts of the world, extreme precipitation events, defined here
       as one that was a 50‑year event (with a 2 percent annual likelihood) in the 1950–81 period,
       are expected to become more common. The likelihood of extreme precipitation events is
       expected to grow more than fourfold in some regions, including parts of China, Central
       Africa, and the east coast of North America, compared with the period 1950–81. As
       discussed in our cases, this could affect global supply chains, infrastructure, and real
       estate around the world.

     — Hurricanes.99 While climate change is seen as unlikely to alter the frequency of
       tropical hurricanes, it is expected to increase the average severity of those storms
       (and thus increase the frequency of severe hurricanes). The likelihood of severe
       hurricane precipitation—that is, an event with a 1 percent likelihood annually in the
       1981 -2000 period—is expected to double in some parts of the southeastern United
       States and triple in some parts of Southeast Asia by 2040. Both are densely populated
       areas with large and globally connected economic activity.




     96
          Throughout this report, we only attempt to quantify changes in climate and do not try to predict weather. We do this
          over two periods: the present to 2030 and the present to 2050. Following standard practice, we define future states as
          the average climatic behavior over multidecade periods. The climate state today is defined as the average conditions
          between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as the average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050 between 2041 and 2060. Unless
          otherwise noted, projections are from WHRC analysis of 20 CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs).
     97
          Taken from KNMI Climate Explorer (2019), using the mean of the full CMIP5 ensemble of models.
     98
          Modeled by WHRC using the median projection from 20 CMIP5 GCMs. To accurately estimate the probability of extreme
          precipitation events, a process known as statistical bootstrapping was used. Because these projections are not
          estimating absolute values, but changes over time, bias correction was not used.
     99
          Modeled by WHRC using the Coupled Hurricane Intensity Prediction System (CHIPS) model from Kerry Emanuel, MIT,
          2019. Time periods available for the hurricane modeling were 1981-2000 baseline, and 2031-2050 future period. These
          are the results for two main hurricane regions of the world. Others, for example, those affecting the Indian sub-continent,
          were not used.

— Drought.100 As the Earth warms, the spatial extent and share of time spent in drought is
  projected to increase. The share of a decade spent in drought conditions is projected to be
  up to 80 percent in some parts of the world by 2050, notably the Mediterranean, southern
  Africa, and Central and South America.

— Lethal heat waves.101 Lethal heat waves are defined as three-day events during which
  average daily maximum “wet-bulb” temperature could exceed the survivability threshold
  for a healthy human being resting in the shade. (Wet-bulb temperature is the lowest
  temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a
  constant pressure.) We took the average wet-bulb temperature of the hottest six-hour
  period across each rolling three-day period as the relevant threshold. The threshold
  maximum temperature chosen for this analysis was 34 degrees Celsius wet-bulb because
  the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35 degrees wet-bulb.
  At this temperature, a healthy human being, resting in the shade, can survive outdoors
  for four to five hours. Large cities with significant urban heat island effects could push
  34 degrees Celsius wet-bulb heat waves over the 35-degree threshold.102 However, the
  degree of urban heat island effect does pose an uncertainty to these projections. These
  projections are also subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric
  aerosols, or air pollution. Atmospheric aerosols reflect a proportion of incoming sunlight
  and therefore artificially cool regions, reducing air temperatures. The trajectory of future
  aerosol levels is uncertain. Under an RCP 8.5 scenario, urban areas in parts of India and
  Pakistan could be the first places in the world to experience heat waves that exceed the
  survivability threshold for a healthy human being, with small regions experiencing more
  than a 60 percent annual chance of such a heat wave by 2050. It should be noted that the
  CMIP5 climate model results show that some of these regions also experience a non-zero
  likelihood of lethal heat waves today, although to date, no region has actually experienced
  such a heat wave. This could be because the CMIP5 models have poor representation of
  the high levels of observed atmospheric aerosols today (see India case for further details).

— Water supply.103 As rainfall patterns across the world change, renewable freshwater
  supply will be affected. Some parts of the world like Australia and South Africa are
  expected to see a decrease in water supply, while other areas, including Ethiopia and parts
  of South America, are projected to see an increase. Certain regions, for example, parts of
  the Mediterranean region, and parts of the United States and Mexico, are projected to see
  a decrease in mean annual surface water supply of more than 70 percent by 2050. Such a
  large decrease in water supply could cause chronic water stress and increase competition
  for resources across sectors.




The five-systems framework we use provides a starting point to assess physical climate risk
and its potential impact on socioeconomic systems around the world. In the following chapter,
we apply this framework to real-world case studies. These highlight the extent to which the
changing climate could affect the economy and society and the nature of physical climate risk,
as well as the types of adaptation measures that could be needed.

      Modeled by WHRC using the mean projection of daily maximum surface temperature and daily mean relative humidity
      taken from 20 CMIP5 GCMs. Models were independently bias corrected using the ERA-Interim dataset. High levels of
      atmospheric aerosols provide a cooling effect that masks the risk. See the India case and technical appendix for more
      details.

      A global analysis of 419 major cities showed that the average daytime temperature difference between urban areas and
      their immediate surroundings is +1.5 ± 1.2°C, with some outliers up to 7°C warmer. Shushi Peng et al., “Surface urban
      heat island across 419 global big cities,” Environmental Science & Technology, January 2012, Volume 46, Issue 2. These
      projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or

   temperature is defined as the lowest temperature to which a parcel of air can be cooled by evaporation at constant pressure. This threshold was
   chosen because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island
   effects could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. Under these conditions, a healthy, well-hydrated human being resting in
   the shade would see core body temperatures rise to lethal levels after roughly 4–5 hours of exposure. These projections are subject to uncertainty
   related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.

3. Physical climate
   risk—a micro view
  In this chapter, we examine how climate hazard becomes risk. We use our five-systems
  framework as a basis for understanding physical climate risk in the near term. We examine
  nine case studies from around the world to assess risks to specific sectors, locations, and
  markets. The cases were chosen based on their exposure to the extremes of climate change
  and their proximity today to key physical and biological thresholds. Each case is specific
  to a geography and an exposed system, and as such is not representative of an “average”
  environment or level of risk across the world. As noted, these cases are based on an RCP
  8.5 climate scenario. By understanding the impact of climate change in a leading-edge case,
  we provide a methodology to assess risk in other instances which may experience rising
  climate change risk in the future.

  Our case studies cover each of the five systems we assess to be directly affected by
  physical climate risk, across geographies and sectors (Exhibit 8). While climate change
  will have an economic impact across many sectors, our cases highlight the impact on
  construction, agriculture, finance, fishing, tourism, manufacturing, real estate, and a range of
  infrastructure-based sectors. The cases include the following:

  — For livability and workability, we look at the risk of exposure to extreme heat and humidity
    in India and what that could mean for that country’s urban population and outdoor-based
    sectors, as well as at the changing Mediterranean climate and how that could affect
    sectors such as wine and tourism.

  — For food systems, we focus on the likelihood of a multiple-breadbasket failure affecting
    wheat, corn, rice, and soy, as well as, specifically in Africa, the impact on wheat and coffee
    production in Ethiopia and cotton and corn production in Mozambique.

  — For physical assets, we look at the potential impact of storm surge and tidal flooding
    on Florida real estate and the extent to which global supply chains, including for
    semiconductors and rare earths, could be vulnerable to the changing climate.

  — For infrastructure services, we examine 17 types of infrastructure assets, including
    the potential impact on coastal cities such as Bristol in England and Ho Chi Minh City
    in Vietnam.

  — Finally, for natural capital, we examine the potential impacts of glacial melt and runoff
    in the Hindu Kush region of the Himalayas; what ocean warming and acidification could
    mean for global fishing and the people whose livelihoods depend on it; as well as potential
    disturbance to forests, which cover nearly one-third of the world’s land and are key to the
    way of life for 2.4 billion people.

Across our cases, we find climate risk will increase by 2030 and grow
further to 2050, often in nonlinear ways
As we noted in Chapter 1, to assess the magnitude of direct physical climate risk in each of the
case studies, we examine the severity of the hazard and its likelihood; the exposure of people,
assets, or economic activity to the hazard; and the extent to which systems are vulnerable to
the hazard. To date, research suggests that the upward trend in economic losses from natural
disasters has primarily been driven by an increase in exposure, rather than climate change
effects.104 Our case studies provide a window into how that is expected to change. We also
assess knock-on impacts from direct risk, for example on GDP or prices, and identify the likely
adaptation response and key decisions, implementation challenges, and costs involved in
each of our cases.

The insights from our cases help highlight the nature and extent of climate risk. Seven
characteristics of physical climate risk stand out. Climate risks are:

— Increasing. In each of our nine cases, the level of climate risk increases by 2030 and
  further by 2050. Extreme heat and flooding drove the greatest increases in risk across
  our leading-edge cases of climate change, with increases in socioeconomic impact of
  between roughly two and 20 times by 2050 versus today’s levels.

— Spatial. Climate hazards manifest locally. The direct impacts of physical climate risk thus
  need to be understood in the context of a geographically defined area. Absent further
  adaptation, our research suggests that the nature of flood risks and potential response in
  Bristol and Ho Chi Minh City could differ, reflecting differences in exposure and severity.
  Likewise, rising temperatures may initially impact India and the Mediterranean in different
  ways. In India, it may impact outdoor work and diminish labor productivity while in the
  Mediterranean it may reduce agricultural yields and tourism. Variations within countries
  are possible or even likely. For example, the coasts and Indo-Gangetic plains in India are
  exposed to higher risk of extreme heat and humidity compared with the higher elevation
  and interior Decca plain, because these regions facilitate the mixing of humid oceanic air
  with hot and dry continental air. Understanding spatial risk requires understanding both
  spatial climatic conditions and how exposure and resilience to those climatic conditions
  vary across geographies.

— Non-stationary. As the Earth continues to warm, physical climate risk is ever-changing or
  non-stationary. Managing that risk will require not moving to a “new normal” but preparing
  for a world of constant change. As we discuss elsewhere in this report, probability
  distributions of temperature continue to shift rightward. Average risk is rising, but tail risk
  is also increasing. For example, in Florida we find average annual losses for residential
  real estate due to storm surge damage are $2 billion today and are projected to increase
  to about $3 billion to $4.5 billion by 2050, with the range depending on whether exposure




104
      Various researchers have attempted to identify the role played by each of these factors in driving economic losses
      to date. Insurance records of losses from acute natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, and forest fires show a clear
      upward trend in losses in real terms over time, and analyses show that the majority of this is driven by an increase in
      exposure. This is based on normalizing the real losses for increases in GDP, wealth, and exposure to strip out the effects
      of a rise in exposure. See for example, Roger Pielke, “Tracking progress on the economic costs of disasters under the
      indicators of the sustainable development goals,” Environmental Hazards, 2019, Volume 18, Number 1. The work by Pielke
      finds no upward trend in economic impact after normalizing the damage data, and indeed a decrease in weather /climate
      losses as a proportion of GDP since 1990. Other researchers find a small upward trend after accounting for effects
      of GDP, wealth, and population, suggesting some potential role of climate change in losses to date. See for example,
      Fabian Barthel and Eric Neumayer, “A trend analysis of normalized insured damage from natural disasters,” Climatic
      Change, 2012, Volume 113, Number 2; and Muir-Wood et al., “The search for trends in a global catalogue of normalized
      weather-related catastrophe losses,” Climate Change and Disaster Losses Workshop, 2006; Robert Ward and Nicola
      Ranger, Trends in economic and insured losses from weather-related events: A new analysis, Centre for Climate Change
      Economics and Policy and Munich Re, November 2010. For example, Muir-Wood et al. conduct analysis of insurance
      industry data between 1970 to 2005 and find that weather-related catastrophe losses have increased by 2 percent each
      year since the 1970s, after accounting for changes in wealth, population growth and movement, and inflation (notably,
      though, in some regions, including Australia, India, and the Philippines, such losses have declined). Analysis by Munich
      Re finds a statistically significant increase in insured losses from weather-related events in the United States and in
      Germany over the past approximately 30 to 40 years.

           is constant or increasing.105 Real estate losses during a 100‑year hurricane event in the
           state are $35 billion today; by 2050, that could rise to $50 billion to $75 billion. In India,
           the number of people with a non-zero probability of experiencing a lethal heat wave is
           effectively zero today and projected to be 160 million to 200 million by 2030 (of which
           80 million to 120 million are estimated not to have air-conditioned homes) and 310 million
           to 480 million by 2050 (of which effectively all are likely to have air-conditioned homes by
           that time).

     — Nonlinear. Climate risk can have nonlinear increases in impacts. As climate hazards
       intensify and become more frequent, our analysis suggests a substantial increase in
       risk. Physical systems, including physiological, human-made and ecological, have either
       evolved or been designed to operate within certain climate parameters (Exhibit 9).
       Even small changes in climate hazard can therefore have significant impact if physical
       thresholds for resilience are breached. Inherent risk is high when regions are already
       close to systemic thresholds for climate hazards. For example, some parts of India are
       close to crossing temperature thresholds that would make outdoor work extremely
       challenging. As of 2017, heat-exposed work produced about 50 percent of GDP, drove
       about 30 percent of GDP growth, and employed about 75 percent of the labor force, some
       380 million people.106

           The human body provides one example of physical thresholds and the nonlinear effect
           if those thresholds are breached. It must maintain a relatively stable core temperature
           of approximately 37 degrees Celsius to function properly. The core temperature needs
           to rise only 0.2 degree to compromise multitasking ability, 0.9 degree to compromise
           neuromuscular coordination, 1.3 degrees to affect simple mental performance, 3 degrees
           to induce dangerous heatstroke, and 5 degrees to cause death.107 In environments where
           air temperatures are higher than core body temperature, the body loses its ability to
           dissipate heat through radiation and convection. Core temperature is determined primarily
           by a combination of activity level and wet-bulb temperature—a measure of air temperature
           and relative humidity—that determines how much heat the body can exhaust through the
           evaporation of sweat. At a wet-bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, healthy, well-
           hydrated human beings resting in the shade would see core temperatures rise to lethal
           levels after roughly four to five hours of exposure.108 Labor capacity would be impaired at
           wet-bulb temperatures well below that.

           Other examples include corn, which has a plant physiological threshold at about
           20 degrees Celsius, beyond which yields decline dramatically. Human-made assets like
           power infrastructure and cell phone towers have been designed with certain tolerances
           for heat, wind, and flooding. Intensifying hazards could thus lead such infrastructure
           assets to fail with increasing frequency. During Hurricane Maria in 2018, for example,
           winds of up to 280 km/h felled more than 90 percent of the cell phone towers in
           Puerto Rico.109

                                      Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                         65


           Extreme heat is already disrupting global air travel. In July 2017, for example, about
           50 flights out of Phoenix, Arizona, were grounded for physical and regulatory reasons
           when temperatures rose to 48 degrees Celsius.110 We find the disruption could increase;
           by 2050, as many as 185,000 passengers per year could be affected by flights that are
           grounded because of extreme heat, according to our estimates.

           The thresholds we describe above pertain to physical systems. The economic, financial,
           and social systems that rely on these physical systems also have thresholds, which
           are harder to quantify. Nonetheless, intensifying direct impacts of climate change
           could trigger nonlinear responses in those systems, too. For example, there could be
           psychological thresholds for home buyers, for when the flooding frequency of homes
           changes from being merely “inconvenient” to “intolerable.” Financial markets, too, may
           hit a point at which they limit long-term lending to risky geographies. Some intensifying
           hazards could even trigger widespread internal or external displacement of people. As
           CO2 concentrations rise and the climate changes, natural systems may not be able to
           evolve fast enough to keep pace, requiring a targeted focus on adaptation action to build
           resilience and prevent such nonlinear responses.

     — Systemic. While the direct impact from physical climate risk is local, it can have knock-
       on effects across regions and sectors, through interconnected socioeconomic systems.
       We find that knock-on impacts could be especially large when people and assets that
       are affected are central to local economies and those local economies are tied into other
       economic and financial systems. Florida’s economy, for example, relies on real estate,
       with 22 percent of GDP, 30 percent of local tax revenue, and home owner wealth linked to
       the sector (primary residences represent 42 percent of median home owner wealth in the
       United States).111 Flooding in the state could thus not only damage housing but also affect
       property values of exposed homes, in turn reducing property tax revenues and potentially
       affecting future price or availability of insurance. We estimate that devaluation of
       flood-exposed homes in Florida could total $10 billion to $30 billion by 2030, all else
       being equal.

     — Regressive. Climate risk is regressive. The poorest communities and populations
       within each of our cases are often the most exposed to climate risk, for example, those
       dependent on outdoor work in areas of increasing heat duress. They are often the most
       vulnerable, lacking financial means. For example, in the case of a multiple breadbasket
       failure, a yield failure in two or more key production regions for rice, wheat, corn, and
       soy, we estimate that prices could spike by 100 percent or more in the short term. This
       would particularly hurt the poorest communities, including the 750 million people living
       below the international poverty line. Climate risk creates spatial inequality, as it may
       simultaneously benefit some regions while hurting others. Rising temperatures may boost
       tourism in areas of northern Europe while reducing the economic vitality of southern ones,
       for example. The volume of water in basins in northern Africa, Greece, and Spain could
       decline by more than 15 percent by 2050 even as the volume in basins in Germany and
       the Netherlands increases by 1 to 5 percent, in turn affecting agriculture such as wine
       and tomatoes.

           Regulators only certify planes to fly below certain temperatures. As air temperature rises, the density of the air decreases
           and negatively affects lift. As a result, planes require a combination of more thrust, lighter takeoff weights, and longer
           runways to take off. See Rhett Allain, “Why Phoenix’s airplanes can’t take off in extreme heat,” Wired, June 20, 2017.

— Under-prepared. While companies and communities have been adapting to reduce
  climate risk, the pace and scale of adaptation may need to increase significantly to
  manage rising levels of physical climate risk. Adaptation can be challenging, as it can entail
  rising costs and tough choices. These could include whether to invest in hardening or to
  relocate people and assets. Adaptation will likely also require coordinated action across
  multiple stakeholders, although this varies across cases. For semiconductor plants,
  effective adaptation might be feasible in a comparatively cost-effective manner through
  either asset hardening or insurance. Due to hazard intensity increasing, the economics
  of adaptation will likely worsen over time, and there may eventually be technical or other
  limits to effective adaptation. In some parts of Florida, the cost of building new sea walls
  and other protection from flooding hazards might increase over time and prove technically
  challenging. If that is the case, hard choices will need to be made between spending on
  hardening or relocation. In other cases, such as warming oceans that reduce the fish
  stocks that fishing communities rely on, collective action may be needed, making the
  path to adaptation more challenging. In some cases, local economic conditions may make
  financing difficult.

Livability and workability: Parts of India could become intolerably hot and humid, while in
the Mediterranean, agriculture and tourism may be affected
In India, the impact of extreme heat and humidity may be underappreciated today as
communities grapple with issues of air quality and water stress. Conditions in the country
are already relatively hot and humid, but rising heat and humidity resulting from the changing
climate could push conditions over physiological thresholds for livability and workability,
in particular for already-vulnerable parts of the population. This will threaten the lives
of millions of people and make outdoor work, which accounts for about half of GDP today, far
more challenging.

Climate models we draw on predict that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, India may become one
of the first places in the world to experience heat waves that cross the survivability threshold
for a healthy human being resting in the shade.112 By 2030, some 160 million to 200 million
people (of whom 80 million to 120 million people are estimated not to have air-conditioned
homes) are expected to live in urban areas with a non-zero probability of such heat waves
occurring. This could rise to between 310 million and 480 million by 2050, without factoring
in air conditioner penetration, which at current rates of growth could rise to cover the full
population by that time.113 Most of this population is projected to live in regions with a roughly
5 percent average annual probability of experiencing a lethal heat wave by 2030, and as much
as 14 percent by 2050 (Exhibit 10). This means that the average person living in an at-risk
region has a probability of roughly 40 percent of experiencing a lethal heat wave at least once
in the decade centered on 2030. In the decade centered on 2050, that probability could rise
to roughly 80 percent.114

      hours. Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber, “An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress,” Proceedings

114
      Note that if atmospheric aerosol concentration does not decrease over the next decade, the probability of lethal heat
      waves could be reduced, as atmospheric aerosols (particularly black carbon) are not currently appropriately represented
      in the CMIP5 ensemble Global Climate Models. See India case for more details.

1. A lethal heat wave is defined as a three-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb, where wet-bulb
   temperature is defined as the lowest temperature to which a parcel of air can be cooled by evaporation at constant pressure. This threshold was
   chosen because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island
   effects could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. Under these conditions, a healthy, well-hydrated human being resting in
   the shade would see core body temperatures rise to lethal levels after roughly 4–5 hours of exposure. These projections are subject to uncertainty
   related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects, and do not factor in air conditioner
   penetration.
Note: See the Technical Appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

As heat and humidity increase, this also could affect labor productivity in outdoor work, as
workers will need to take breaks to avoid heatstroke. Moreover, their bodies will protectively
fatigue, in a so-called self-limiting process, to avoid overheating. We estimate that the
effective number of outdoor daylight hours lost in an average year because of diminished
labor productivity would increase by about 15 percent by 2030 compared with today,
equivalent to an additional four weeks of work from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. lost, assuming a 12-hour
workday.115 This would likely cause a reduction in GDP of between 2.5 and 4.5 percent by
2030, where the range is based on the 25th and 75th percentile climate model ensemble
projections (Exhibit 11).116 By 2050, it is expected that some parts of India will be under such
intense heat and humidity duress that working outside would effectively not be feasible for
almost 30 percent of annual daylight hours. The urban poor without access to cooling systems
and those engaged in outdoor activities like agriculture and construction will be among the
vulnerable who are disproportionately affected.

India, however, has potential for adaptation in the short term. Steps include early-warning
systems and cooling shelters to protect those without air-conditioning. Working hours for
outdoor workers could be shifted, and cities could implement albedo heat-management
efforts. At the extreme, coordinated movement of people and capital from high-risk areas
could be organized. Beyond the costs involved, adaptation could be challenging if it changes
how people conduct their daily lives or requires them to move to less at-risk areas.

Rising temperatures would also affect the Mediterranean, albeit with less severe impacts
than in India. The mild Mediterranean climate will grow hotter, which could disrupt key
industries such as tourism and agriculture. By 2050, drought conditions are expected to
prevail for at least six months of every year (Exhibit 12).117 Even under a conservative scenario
of reduced emissions, Madrid’s climate in 2050 is projected to resemble today’s climate in
Marrakech, while the climate in Marseille in 2050 may be like that of Algiers today.118 Climate
scientists expect an increase in the number of days considered uncomfortably hot in many
Mediterranean beach tourism locations, while northern European coasts could become more
agreeable as summer holiday destinations. This could change visitor flows and exacerbate
spatial inequality.119 Farmers have already seen their crop yields diminish and become less
predictable, a trend that is likely to continue.120 Areas known for the quality of their wine
grapes risk losing their prominence on the viticulture map, while nontraditional growing
regions may gain advantage.

Adaption will need to be place-based, given the strong ties to location of agriculture and
tourism. For example, wineries could harvest earlier, reduce sunlight on grapes, or irrigate
vineyards. Additionally, approaches such as modified fertilizer use and planting resilient
varieties of crops might mitigate decreases in yield.121 Tourism destinations at risk from rising
summer temperatures might explore ways to shift visitor flows to shoulder seasons and
diversify local economies.

      precipitation-based metric calculated based on deviation from historical mean. Values range from +4 (extremely wet) to
      -4 (extremely dry).

      Our analysis does not account for the potential migration of planting areas for a crop within a country. For farmers who
      can change what they grow, this can create opportunities. For example, a high-latitude country like Canada could have
      significantly increased agricultural opportunities due to climate change. But in many countries, as the crop-growing
      regions shift, farmers may not be able to adapt.

     Food systems: A global yield shock is projected to become more likely, while African
     countries may experience shifts in their agricultural endowment
     We find an increasing risk of a concurrent harvest failure in multiple breadbasket locations, an
     example of a tail event. We define a multiple breadbasket failure as a global harvest decline
     of 15 percent relative to average.122 About 60 percent of global grain production today occurs
     in just five regional breadbaskets, and four grains make up almost half of the calories in the
     average global diet (Exhibit 13). Rising temperatures, changing patterns of precipitation,
     and increasing episodes of climate-related stress such as drought, heat waves, and floods
     are expected to raise the likelihood of a multiple-breadbasket failure in the decades ahead.
     However, it is also important to note that some countries are projected to benefit and
     experience rising yields due to climate change; we discuss this further in Chapter 4.123

     We estimate that the chance of a greater than 15 percent yield shock at least once in the
     decade centered on 2030 rises from 10 percent today to 18 percent, while the chance of
     a greater than 10 percent yield shock occurring at least once rises from 46 to 69 percent
     (Exhibit 14).124 Since there is a built-up stock of grain (current stock-to-use ratios are high, at
     30 percent of consumption), such a yield shock would most likely not directly lead to food
     shortages. It is highly unlikely that the world will run out of grain within any one year. However,
     even limited reductions in stock-to-use ratios have triggered episodes of food price spikes.
     A 15 percent drop in global supply, for example, would likely cause stock-to-use ratios to
     drop to about 20 percent. In that case, historical precedent suggests that prices could spike
     by 100 percent or more in the short term, although we acknowledge that food commodity
     prices are difficult to predict. If such a food price spike were to occur, this would particularly
     hurt poor people worldwide, including the 750 million people living below the international
     poverty line.

     To make the food system more resilient, private and public research could be expanded. For
     instance, research on technologies could aim to make crops more resistant to abiotic and
     biotic stresses. This may include conventional breeding, gene editing, and other biological
     or physical approaches. To offset the risk of a harvest failure of greater than 15 percent,
     the current global stock-to-use ratio could be increased to 35 to 40 percent, leveraging
     times of surplus and low prices. We estimate total costs for the required additional storage
     at between $5 billion and $11 billion per year. Investment in water management systems
     is another potential adaptation measure. Incentives for farmers, however, are not aligned
     with stock buildup. Storing grain can be expensive (given direct costs as well as working
     capital requirements), and the reduced risk of food shortages is to some extent a positive
     externality that farmers do not necessarily factor into their cost-benefit analysis. Multilateral
     organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations could
     potentially play a role, managing storage closely to prevent “leakages” and encouraging the
     private sector to store more grains. In any case, affected stakeholders may need to work
     together to solve storage issues, possibly through global interventions.




     122
           We define a breadbasket as a key production region for food grains (rice, wheat, corn, and soy) and harvest failure as
           a major yield reduction in the annual crop cycle of a breadbasket region where there is a potential impact on the global
           food system. Note that we are taking into account potentially positive effects on plant growth from higher CO2 levels
           (“CO2 fertilization”). However, those benefits could be reduced as increased CO2 levels could lead to a reduction in the
           protein and micronutrient content of crops, which in turn would require humans to eat more volume to achieve the same
           level of nutrition. For more detail, see Chunwu Zhu et al., “Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels this century will alter the protein,
           micronutrients, and vitamin content of rice grains with potential health consequences for the poorest rice-dependent
           countries,” Science Advances, May 23, 2018, Volume 4, Number 5.
     123
           For this case, we modeled only the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation on yields. We did not model
           extreme events (such as flooding, hail, or extreme wind) nor the impact of pests and diseases.

                                           In Africa, agriculture is critical to the continent’s economic growth and development,
                                           generating more than one-fifth of sub-Saharan Africa’s economic output. Yet we find that
                                           rising temperatures and the increased likelihood of drought are expected to create significant
                                           volatility in agricultural yields in some parts of Africa and for certain crops, which would make
                                           investment decisions and economic development more challenging (Exhibits 15 and 16).
                                           Besides increasing storage levels, crop insurance may be an option to manage these climate-
                                           related risks. While insurance policies in theory are easy to establish, financing may be an
                                           issue because farmers might not have sufficient means to pay their premiums.

                                           We analyze how precipitation volatility affects crop yields in two African countries, Ethiopia
                                           and Mozambique. In Ethiopia, we project that by 2030, wheat farmers are 11 percent more
                                           likely to experience a 10 percent or greater decrease in yield in any given year compared with
                                           today. The same decrease becomes 23 percent more likely by 2050. For coffee growers, the
                                           likelihood of a 25 percent or greater drop in yield in any given year currently stands at about
                                           3 percent but is expected to climb to about 4 percent, a roughly 30 percent increase, by 2030.
                                           Should yield shocks of this magnitude take place for both crops in the same year, Ethiopia’s
                                           GDP would drop about 3 percent in that year.125

                                                 To gauge the potential economic effects of changes in Ethiopia’s wheat and coffee production, we relied on the economic
                                                 modeling capabilities of the International Food Policy Research Institute. Researchers there incorporated our near-
                                                 term yield predictions in their country economic models. These models estimate how reduced crop production affects
                                                 downstream sectors (such as food processing and trade) and the broader economy (for example, GDP, foreign trade,
                                                 and rural and urban household incomes), along with input-output flows between sectors and consumers, accounting for
                                                 macroeconomic and resource constraints (foreign exchange constraints on food imports, for example). See Africa case

In Mozambique, two of the most important crops are corn (maize), which is grown primarily
as a food crop, and cotton, which is raised primarily as a cash crop for export. Our analysis
suggests that the changing climate will make corn yields more volatile and have the opposite
effect on cotton, which typically prefers hotter temperatures. In the case of corn, the
likelihood of a large seasonal crop loss (exceeding 30 percent) is currently near zero. By
2030, we project that such a loss will have a 2 percent likelihood of occurring in a given year.
However, our projections also indicate that the likelihood of unusually high yields (20 to
30 percent greater than normal) will also increase.126 Cotton growers in Mozambique, by
contrast, are projected to experience more stability in yields and thus to benefit from the
effects of climate change. We project that a 20 percent or greater drop in yields, compared
with average yields, will be 95 percent less likely in 2030 than it was between 1990 and
now. Barring other influences, like changes in pests, this reduction in volatility should help
the many rural households that rely on cotton crops for much of their income (overall, cotton
contributes about one-fifth of Mozambique’s agricultural export earnings).

Physical assets: Increased flooding in Florida could have financial costs beyond physical
damages. For supply-chains, rising risk of disruption may require hardening production
sites and raising inventories
In Florida, expected direct physical damages to real estate are expected to grow with the
changing climate, but financial knock-on effects could be even greater. Storm surge from
hurricanes is projected to become more severe and tidal flooding more frequent.127 The
geography of the state—an expansive coastline, low elevation, and a porous limestone
foundation—makes it vulnerable to flooding and makes adaptation challenging. Rising sea
levels could push saltwater into the freshwater supply and damage water management
systems. Climate hazards will likely have a direct impact on home owners as well as significant
knock-on effects on the state’s economy more broadly.

With increasing hurricane intensity and rising sea levels, tail events are likely to cause more
impact and become more likely than they are today. Florida’s real estate losses during storm
surge from a 100‑year hurricane event would be $35 billion today, which are forecast to grow
to $50 billion by 2050, assuming no change in building stock (Exhibit 17).128 . Real estate is both
a physical and a financial store of value for most economies. Damages and the expectation
of future damages to homes and infrastructure could drive down prices of exposed homes.
The state’s assets and people and its economic activity tend to be concentrated in coastal
areas exposed to these hazards. Based on historical trends on the impacts of frequent
tidal flooding, devaluation of exposed homes could be $10 billion to $30 billion in 2030 and
$30 billion to $80 billion in 2050, all else being equal.129 This corresponds to about a 15 to
35 percent impact. The devaluation could be significantly larger if climate hazards affect
public infrastructure assets like water, sewage, and transportation systems, or if home owners
more deliberately factor climate risk into their buying decisions. For example, rough estimates
suggest that the price effects discussed above could impact property tax revenue in some of
the most affected counties by about 15 to 30 percent (though impacts across the state could
be less, at about 2 to 5 percent).




126
      Although the country’s overall corn production is projected to become more volatile, the impacts we modeled for corn
      crops obscure the possibility that impacts could differ from one area to another. Subnational predictions for agro-
      ecological zones will better inform country planning.

                                       As already noted earlier in this chapter, lower real estate prices could have knock-on effects
                                       including forgone property taxes, which could affect municipal bond ratings and the spending
                                       power of local governments on adaptation as well as broader infrastructure investment.
                                       Business activity could be negatively affected, as could the price or availability of insurance
                                       and mortgage financing in high-risk areas. Home owners cannot protect against the risk of
                                       devaluation with insurance. Furthermore, while mortgages can be 30 years long, insurance
                                       is repriced every year. This duration mismatch means that current risk signals from insurance
                                       premiums might not build in the expected risk over an asset’s lifetime. This may lead to
                                       insufficiently informed decisions. If insurance premiums rise to account for future climate
                                       change, this could create a risk to lending activity for new homes and to the wealth of existing
                                       home owners.

                                       Even home owners who are not financially distressed may choose to strategically default
                                       if their homes fall steeply in value with little prospect of recovery. One comparison point is
                                       Texas: during the first months after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, the mortgage

delinquency rate almost doubled, from about 7 to 14 percent.130 As mortgage lenders start
to recognize these risks, they could change lending rates for risky properties or, in some
cases, stop providing 30‑year mortgages. This would affect both individuals and the
state’s economy.

Adaptation poses hard choices in Florida and will require thoughtful planning and preparation.
For example, should the state increase hurricane and flooding protection or curtail
development in risk-prone areas and perhaps even abandon some of them? The Center for
Climate Integrity estimates that 9,200 miles of seawalls would be necessary to protect Florida
by 2040, at a cost of $76 billion.131 Seawalls are only one part of the solution and may also not
be technically or economically viable in the entire state. Other strategies include hardening
and improving the resiliency of existing infrastructure and installing new green infrastructure.

Our examination of the potential impact of climate change on supply chains suggests that
the knock-on effects could be more significant than the physical asset damage. Global
supply chains are typically optimized for efficiency over resiliency and hence often designed
with low buffers, for example regarding inventory. We identify a spectrum of supply chains
to help assess the nature of climate risk that companies may face. These include specialty,
commodity, and intermediate supply chains (Exhibit 18). We focus on two global supply chains:
semiconductors, a specialty supply chain, and heavy rare earths, a commodity.

For semiconductors, the probability of an event with the magnitude of what is today a
1-in-100‑year hurricane, with the potential to disrupt semiconductor manufacturing,
occurring in any given year in the western Pacific, is projected to double or even quadruple
by 2040. In this scenario, such hurricanes could potentially lead to months of lost production
for the directly affected companies. For unprepared downstream players, for example, those
without buffer inventories, insurance, or the ability to find alternate suppliers, the revenue
loss in a disaster year could be as high as 35 percent, according to our estimates. For heavy
rare earths, which are mined in southeastern China, the likelihood of extreme rainfall in the
region sufficient to trigger mine and road closures is projected to rise from about 2.5 percent
per year today to about 4 percent per year in 2030 and 6 percent in 2050.132 Given the
commoditized nature of this supply chain, impacts on production could result in increased
prices for all downstream players.

Building hazard-protected plants and boosting inventory levels could prepare companies
for the immediate consequences of climate risk. Securing plants in southeast Asia against
hazards comes at a comparatively low cost, of approximately 2 percent of building costs. In
both cases of rare earths and semiconductors, downstream players could mitigate impacts
by holding higher inventory levels and by sourcing from different suppliers across multiple
geographies. For buyers of semiconductors, raising inventory to provide a meaningful buffer
could be quite cost-effective, with estimated costs for warehousing and working capital
increasing input costs by less than 1 percent.

Implementation is relatively straightforward because it lies within the responsibility of specific
actors. Nonetheless, it comes at the cost of decreased efficiency in production processes, for
example by creating limitations on lean or just-in-time inventory.

Infrastructure services: Flood management and other infrastructure will require
adaptation investment to address growing hazard and potential knock-on effects
We find growing risk from climate change across all 17 types of infrastructure assets
we examined in the domains of energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications
(Exhibit 19). Both the asset itself and the economic activity it sustains are at risk. This can
create significant knock-on effects.

Each infrastructure asset type has unique vulnerabilities to climate hazards. In transportation,
for example, only a few millimeters of flooding on an airport runway can cause disruption. With
25 percent of the world’s 100 busiest airports less than 10 meters above sea level, coastal
flooding and risk from storms could be a serious vulnerability.133 Extreme heat may cause
shutdowns and efficiency losses in some airports and with some aircraft models, but it is not
expected to be a significant risk for most airports over the coming decades. Rail and roads
are more affected by flooding than by heat, because of the vulnerability of signaling systems
to water exposure and the traffic-slowing effects of even small amounts of water; traffic can
slow by 30 percent with even a few centimeters of water on a road’s surface.134

Telecommunications infrastructure assets may be affected only to a minimal or moderate
degree by climate hazards, although cell phone towers and cables are vulnerable to high
winds. In Puerto Rico, 90 percent of towers were downed by 280 kilometer-per-hour winds
from Hurricane Maria in 2017, and in New York during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, 80-mile-per-
hour winds downed 25 percent of towers.135 Freshwater infrastructure such as reservoirs,
wells, and aquifers are vulnerable to sustained drought conditions. Coastal, riverine, and
pluvial flooding can also overwhelm and damage wastewater treatment infrastructure and
water treatment systems. Hurricane Sandy, for example, led to the release of 11 billion gallons
of sewage as coastal wastewater systems were inundated.136

The power grid is also vulnerable. Extreme heat can lead to the combined effects of efficiency
losses and increase in peak load from greater use of air-conditioning. One example is the
electricity grid infrastructure in Los Angeles County, which could be at risk of overloading and
load shedding.137

The knock-on effects may also be significant but hard to estimate. Strain on government
services and public health services would increase immediately. In the longer term, if outages
become a regular occurrence, businesses—particularly small and medium-size enterprises
that are less able to tolerate interruptions than larger operations—may lose productivity or
choose to relocate.

Adaptation costs for infrastructure are typically estimated to be fairly low relative to total
spending, about 1 to 2 percent of total annual infrastructure spending.138 The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, which manages infrastructure within the city of Los Angeles,
plans to replace 800 transformers each year between 2017 and 2020.

      overloading would increase significantly, pushing some substations to automatic shut-off mode, disconnecting entire
      neighborhoods and leaving others with significant load shedding. California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment,

In urban areas, floods from extreme events could leave populations without critical services
such as power, transportation, and communications. We find the potential direct and
knock-on effects of flooding to be significant. In the case of Bristol, a port city in the west of
England that has not experienced major flooding for decades, we find that absent adaptation
investment, extreme flood risk could grow from a problem costing millions of dollars today
to costing billions by 2065. During very high tides, the river Avon becomes “tide locked”
and limits land drainage in the lower reaches of river catchment area. As a result, Bristol is
vulnerable to combined tidal and pluvial floods, which are sensitive to both sea-level rise
and precipitation increase. Both are expected to climb with climate change. While Bristol is
generally hilly and most of the urban area is far from the river, the most economically valuable
areas of the city center and port regions are on comparatively low-lying land. More than
200 hectares of automotive storage near the port could be vulnerable to even low levels of
floodwater, and the main train station could become inaccessible. Bristol has flood defenses
that would prevent the vast majority of damage from an extreme flood event today. By 2065,
as extreme flood risk rises, however, those defenses could be overwhelmed, in which case
water would reach infrastructure that was previously safe.139

Specifically, we estimate that a 200‑year flood today (that is, a flood of 0.5 percent likelihood
per year) in Bristol would cause infrastructure asset damages totaling between $10 million
and $25 million. This is projected to rise to $180 million to $390 million by 2065, for what
will then constitute a 200‑year event. The costs of knock-on effects could also rise, from
$20 million to $150 million today to as much as $2.8 billion by 2065, if businesses became
unable to function, industrial stores were destroyed, and transportation halted.140 That impact
translates to between 2 and 9 percent of the city’s gross value added in 2065. As an outside-
in estimate, based on scaling costs to build the Thames Barrier in 1982, plus additional
localized measures that might be needed, protecting the city to 2065 may cost $250 million
to $500 million (roughly 0.5 to 1.5 percent of Bristol’s GVA today). However, the actual costs
will largely depend on the specific adaptation approach.

For Ho Chi Minh City, a city prone to monsoonal and storm surge flooding, we estimate
that direct infrastructure asset damage from a 100‑year flood today (that is, a flood of
1 percent likelihood per year) could be on the order of $200 million to $300 million, rising
to $500 million to $1 billion in 2050, assuming no additional adaptation investment and not
including real estate–related impacts. Here, too, the knock-on costs in economic activity
disrupted are expected to be more substantial, rising from between $100 million and
$400 million today to $1.5 billion to $8.5 billion in 2050.141

Many new infrastructure assets, particularly the local metro system, have been designed
to tolerate an increase in flooding. Yet the hazards to which these assets may be subjected
could be greater even than the higher thresholds. In a worst-case scenario of 180 centimeters
of sea-level rise, these thresholds could be breached in many locations, and some assets
possibly damaged beyond repair (Exhibit 20).




139
      Data for this case and expert review were kindly provided by Bristol City Council.
140
      Our model assumptions suggest that a flood could cause damage to a major power plant, inundate a major substation
      that feeds an area covering approximately 20 to 30 percent of Bristol, cut off the main train station from all access, and
      flood the port, including one of the largest car storage areas in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of 90,000 new
      automobiles. It may also cause $160 million to $240 million of property damage, particularly to high-value riverfront
      homes and large swaths of the central business district, as well as $10 million to $130 million of lost infrastructure
      operating revenues, largely dependent on whether the power station is disrupted.
141
      For our modeling, we assume that 36 percent of the city becomes flooded. Small increases in flood exposure and flood
      depth would be enough to trip the thresholds of some infrastructure, with the average flooded asset at 0.5 meter.
      In addition, many of the 200 new infrastructure assets are planned to be built in flooded areas. New, sensitive, and
      expensive assets such as the city’s underground metro stations in the highest-risk areas would be damaged. Damaged
      assets could include 5 percent of new metro stations, 50 percent of data centers, 10 percent of wastewater facilities, two
      power stations, 30 percent of substations, and a port. Roads would begin to reach damage thresholds, with 10 percent
      requiring repair. About $8.4 billion of damage could also be incurred on real estate as larger areas flood to greater
      depths. See case study for details.

Compared with Bristol, Ho Chi Minh City has many more adaptation options, as less than
half of the city’s major infrastructure needed for 2050 exists today. Potential adaptation
options could be effective. However, it is unlikely that any single measure will be easy or
without disadvantages, A tidal barrier is one example of a potential hardening measure. A cost
estimate for the Soài Rap tidal barrier is not available. However, one potential comparison is
Jakarta’s major coastal defense plans, which have a potential cost of roughly $40 billion. That
is comparable to Ho Chi Minh City’s current GDP.142

Natural capital: Climate change may accelerate the destruction of natural capital
such as glaciers, ocean ecosystems, and forests, and the services they provide to
human communities
Natural capital is found globally and is defined as the world’s stock of natural resources
(Exhibit 21). Climate change is having a substantial impact on natural capital. We look at three
manifestations of climate change impact on natural capital globally: glacier melt, ocean
warming and acidification, and forest disturbance.

Natural capital is one of the most challenging domains in which to understand and respond
to the effects of climate change. Protecting and adapting natural capital is a complex task
because the systems and their interconnections can be difficult to understand and the
effectiveness of solutions may be fully assessed only over the long term. Experts could create
metrics, data, and tools to measure nature’s benefits to people and monitor natural capital;
provide tangible ways to identify trade-offs; and better understand complex ecosystem
dynamics, including feedbacks and the impact of climate change.

Glaciers in most parts of the world are shrinking. They are losing an average of 335 billion
tons of snow and ice each year, enough to raise sea levels by almost one millimeter per
year.143 In the longer term, this loss will diminish the flow of glacier-fed rivers that provide one-
sixth of the world’s people with freshwater for drinking and irrigation.144 In the Hindu Kush
Himalayan region, where glaciers provide water for more than 240 million people, glacial
mass is expected to drop by about 10 to 25 percent by 2030, and by 20 to 40 percent by
2050 in some subregions.145 In response, integrated water planning and management across
sectors (such as energy, land, forest, ecosystems, and agriculture) could make water use more
efficient and reduce environmental impacts. More water storage could help when discharges
are low. Physical protections (such as flood-prevention structures, better irrigation systems,
upgraded canals, precision land leveling, and proper implementation and enforcement of
building codes) and management tools (such as land-use planning laws and early-warning
systems) are also needed to manage risk.

At the same time, the world’s oceans are becoming warmer, less oxygenated, and more
acidic. By 2050, ocean warming is expected to reduce fish catches by about 8 percent and
associated revenue by about 10 percent, affecting the livelihoods of 650 million to 800 million
people globally who directly or indirectly rely on these revenues.146 Catch potential in many
tropical regions is projected to decline by up to 50 percent, hurting fishing communities
in those regions even more.147 Experts have suggested that mitigating pressures (such as
pollution, commercial fishing, invasive species, and coastal habitat modification) could reduce
and delay the effects of climate change on the world’s oceans. Potential adaptation measures
include creation of alternative livelihoods and retraining of fishing crews. In the short term,
better governance mechanisms could protect regional marine ecosystems and the services
they provide. To help fishing communities, microcredit mechanisms have been set up in four
of Senegal’s marine protected areas to help fishing communities develop alternative sources
of income.

 Forests cover nearly one-third of the world’s land. About 1.6 billion people depend on them to
make their living and some 2.4 billion people use wood as fuel to cook, boil and sterilize water,
and heat their dwellings.148 Like oceans, forests act as important carbon sinks; the biosphere
currently absorbs approximately 30 percent of fossil fuel CO2 emissions, with the majority
stored in forests and mangroves. Because forests take a long time to grow but then live for
decades or longer, they are likely to face risks from both changes in mean climate variables
and extreme weather events like prolonged drought, wildfires, storms, and floods.149 This
is especially relevant when considering that fires, drought, and insect activity are likely to
increase in warmer and drier conditions.150 Although forests can be restored, their full range of
ecosystem services might not recover.

Potential adaptation measures for natural capital in general include sustaining important
ecological functions by means of interventions, for example by altering hydrology to help
ecosystems during droughts and by maintaining and restoring coastal vegetation. Moreover,
ecosystems can be made more adaptable, for instance by enhancing genetic diversity within
and among species, as well as by investing in green infrastructure by integrating natural
processes with spatial planning and territorial development. Where natural capital is already
lost, economic diversification may help communities adapt.




From our case study analysis, we gain insight into both the nature of climate risk and the way
climate risk is evolving. Across the cases, we note some key characteristics that include the
non-stationary and nonlinear nature of impacts, as well as the systemic, knock-on effects
that these can produce. Our estimates of climate risk based on these cases suggest both
an increase in physical climate risk by 2030 and even more by 2050, and the importance
of looking at that risk through a spatial approach, given that some geographies and sectors
tend to experience more significant impact than others. In the next chapter, we use a detailed
geospatial analysis of 105 countries to highlight how climate risk could evolve globally.

4. Physical climate
   risk—a macro view
  While our case studies illustrate localized impacts of a changing climate and help us
  understand the nature of physical climate risk, rising temperatures and the resulting hazards
  are a global trend. To understand how physical climate risk could evolve around the world,
  we developed a global geospatial assessment of direct impact from climate change over
  the next 30 years covering 105 countries. This geospatial analysis relies on the same five-
  systems framework of direct impacts that we used for the case studies and is based on an
  RCP 8.5 climate scenario. We used the framework to derive a set of six indicators that assess
  potential impacts across countries.151 Using these indicators, we arrived at a global view of
  how many lives could be affected, as well as the impact on physical and natural capital. We
  also discuss the implications for economic activity.152 (See Box 2, “Methodology for global
  geospatial analysis”).

  We find that all 105 countries we studied would see an increase in potential direct impacts
  from climate change for at least one indicator by 2030, and further increases to 2050.
  Of these, 16 countries—roughly 15 percent—would see an increase in three indicators by
  2050 compared to today, while 44 countries see an increase in five of six indicators.

  Climate change is not occurring uniformly, and risk varies across countries. We look at
  individual countries to identify the nature and magnitude of physical climate risk in each case
  and draw out patterns.




  151
        Significant data constraints limited both the choice of our six indicators and the number of countries we included in the
        analysis. For countries, the minimum skillful predictive scale of GCMs prevented the creation of robust projections for a
        set of small countries.
  152
        To conduct this analysis, we have relied on geospatial climate hazard data, including from Woods Hole Research Center
        analysis of CMIP5 Global Climate Model output, the World Resources Institute, the European Center for Medium-Range
        Weather Forecasts and data from Rubel et al. (obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). We
        used geospatial data on population, capital stock, and GDP from the European Commission Global Human Settlement
        (GHS) and the UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, as well as data from other sources as described
        in Box 2. Notably, we have focused our analysis on a subset of possible climate hazards: lethal heat waves, heat and
        humidity and its impact on workability, water stress, riverine flooding, drought, and biome shifts. In some places, we also
        include a discussion about hurricanes.

    The analytical process began with the full set of 195 member countries of the United Nations. Following the findings of Stanley L. Grotch and Michael Calvin
    McCracken, “The Use of General Circulation Models to Predict Regional Climatic Change,” Journal of Climate, March 1991, Volume 4, Issue 3, any countries with a
    land surface smaller than the resolution of eight grid points was removed, leaving only countries with enough spatial area to be described by Global Climate Models.
    This process left a set of 105 countries. A hazard-by-hazard robustness check was then performed. Some projections (water supply, biome shift, and flooding) were
    drawn from external organizations that performed their own robustness checks. For the materially new analyses performed by WHRC, different quality control
    methods were applied. In some cases, particularly the projections of wet-bulb temperature, bias-correction and spatial disaggregation were performed to improve
    robustness. The PDSI drought projections were corrected to account for changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. With regards to agricultural results drawn from
    the AgMIP family of models, many of the results for the 105 identified countries were not assessed as robust, due to either small levels of agricultural production or
    small geographic spread of producing regions. As a result, we present only global and regional aggregated breadbasket results.

     Growing climate hazards could put millions of lives, physical capital, and
     natural capital at risk
     As climate hazards manifest, they directly create and amplify socioeconomic risk as they
     impact exposed people, physical and natural capital. In this geospatial analysis, as elsewhere
     in this report, we assess the nature of inherent risk—that is, risk not adjusted for adaptation
     response—experienced across countries using our five-systems framework. We do not
     attempt to calculate global adaptation costs, which others have estimated (see Box 3,
     “Estimates of adaptation costs”).




        Box 3
        Estimates of adaptation costs

        While we have focused on potential adaptation measures in the case studies in this
        research, we have not attempted to size the cost of adaptation globally. Organizations
        that have sought to estimate adaptation spending in the next few decades include the
        UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA).
        In 2016, UNEP identified adaptation costs of $140 billion to $300 billion per year for
        developing countries, rising to $280 billion to $500 billion annually by 2050.1

        In 2019, the GCA calculated necessary adaptation investments between 2020 and
        2030 of $1.8 trillion, equivalent to less than 1 percent of projected total gross fixed
        capital formation in the period.2 The calculated investments comprise strengthening
        early warning systems, making new infrastructure resilient, improving dryland
        agriculture crop production, protecting mangroves, and making water resources
        management more resilient. Adaptation investment can not only help reduce risk,
        but also result in other benefits. The GCA identified three categories of benefits from
        adaptation: avoided losses of lives and assets, for example as a result of early-warning
        systems for storms or heat waves; positive economic benefits, for example reduced
        flood risk in urban areas leading to broader economic investments; and social and
        environmental benefits, for example as a result of coastal protection measures such
        as green spaces for flood protection, which in turn improve community cohesion and
        quality of life.

        While these are global estimates, it is important to note that adaptation costs
        are ultimately incurred at a local level, by individual countries, communities, or
        companies, and financing of adaptation may be challenging depending on specific
        economic conditions.

As in our cases, our estimates are primarily statistically expected outcomes in an average
year. In any given year, outcomes could be better or worse than this average, an important
factor to understand for risk management. We therefore also illustrate “tail” outcomes with
select examples.153

As stocks of human, physical, and natural capital are directly affected by a changing climate,
this would also affect GDP. While we do not attempt to quantify the total impact of climate
change on global GDP, we do include a discussion of the short-run impacts on the level of
GDP from outdoor working hours lost due to extreme heat and humidity and the impact of
yield failure.154 Beyond direct impacts, destruction of stocks of physical, human, and natural
capital could have longer-term effects on GDP which we do not include or estimate (see
Box 4, “Why we have not made an estimate of the impact of climate change and adaptation
on global GDP”). Note also that our assessment of short-run GDP effects primarily focuses
on the implications on directly affected sectors, and in some cases connected sectors, but
does not consider systemic knock-on effects that could occur as the impact manifests (for
example, the impact on financial markets, migration, etc.).

We highlight findings about potential global impacts from physical climate risk over the
30 years to 2050 below and explore the range of impacts in more detail thereafter:

— In our inherent risk assessment under an RCP 8.5 climate scenario, the number of people
  living in areas having non-zero annual likelihood of heat waves that exceed the threshold
  for survivability for a healthy human being in the shade is projected to rise from essentially
  zero today to 250 million to 360 million by 2030. By 2050, that figure could rise further to
  between 700 million and 1.2 billion people. Both numbers do not factor in air conditioner
  penetration. Today, air conditioner penetration is roughly 10 percent across India, and
  roughly 60 percent across China.155 The ranges here are based on different population
  projections for different countries, which influence how many people live in at-risk
  regions.156 The increase is significant in part because the hottest and most humid parts
  of the world tend to be among the most heavily populated, and these areas are becoming
  even hotter and more humid. For the people living in these regions, the average annual
  likelihood of experiencing such a heat wave is projected to rise to 14 percent by 2050;
  however, some regions are expected to have higher probability, and some regions lower.
  This means that the cumulative average likelihood of a person living in an at-risk area to
  experience such a heat wave at least once over a ten-year period centered on 2050 is
  estimated to be 80 percent.157




153
      It is important to note that such tail impacts cannot be meaningfully added together. Because these are unlikely “tail”
      events, the probability of more than one of these events occurring in the same year is very small. For example, the
      likelihood of two (independent) events of 1 percent probability occurring in the same year is 0.01 percent.
154
      This discussion excludes a variety of hazards and their impacts. They include lethal heat waves, water scarcity, sea-level
      rise, extreme precipitation, hurricanes, chronic heat and disease vector impact on human health, and forest fires. GDP at
      risk includes both direct effects and immediate knock-on effects, which are calculated using input-output multipliers.

156
      Range is based on the range of population projections from the UN World Population Prospects and the UN World
      Urbanization Prospects, to bound population growth based on high and low variants, and based on urban and total
      population growth rates. We assume the spatial composition within a country of population remains the same as today,
      given data availability on geospatial population footprint.
157
      As noted in Chapter 2, lethal heat waves are defined as a three-day period with average daily maximum wet-bulb
      temperatures exceeding 34 degrees Celsius wet-bulb. The current lethal heat wave risk is restricted to a small area along
      the Pakistan-India border. Because of the high atmospheric aerosol concentrations there, a cooling effect is created,
      such that there is no impact today. If a non-zero probability of lethal heat waves in certain regions occurred in the models
      for today, this was set to zero to account for the poor representation of the high levels of observed atmospheric aerosols
      in those regions in the CMIP5 models. High levels of atmospheric aerosols provide a cooling effect that masks the risk.
      See India case for further details. This analysis excludes grid-cells where the the likelihood of lethal heat waves is <1
      percent, to eliminate areas of low statistical significance. Cumulative likelihood calculated for the decade centered on
      2030 and 2050 by using annual probabilities for the climate state in the 2030 period and the 2050 period, respectively.
      Annual probabilities are independent and can therefore be aggregated to arrive at a cumulative decadal probability. This
      calculation is a rough approximation as follows: it assumes that the annual probability of X percent applies to every year
      in the decade centered on 2030 or 2050. We first calculate the cumulative probability of a heat wave not occurring in that
      decade, which is 1 minus X raised to the power of 10. The cumulative probability of a heat wave occurring at least once in
      the decade is then 1 minus that number. Analysis based on an RCP 8.5 scenario.




Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                                          93


     — The global average share of annual outdoor working hours potentially lost due to
       extreme heat and humidity in exposed regions could almost double by mid-century,
       from 10 percent today to 10 to 15 percent by 2030 and 15 to 20 percent by 2050. This
       workability impact occurs because more regions of the world are exposed to heat stress
       and because the regions that are exposed are projected to see higher intensity of heat
       stress. The ranges here are based on whether the “average” year manifests, or a colder
       than average or hotter than average period occurs.

     — As outdoor working hours are affected, this has an impact on GDP. We consider the share
       of GDP in climate-exposed regions that could be lost from decreased workability (that
       is, an impact on outdoor working hours from increased heat and humidity) in agriculture,
       construction, and mining. We find that could rise to 2 to 3.5 percent by 2050, representing
       $4 trillion to $6 trillion in GDP at risk in an average year.158 This is up from 1.5 percent today.
       About a third of the countries examined could see 5 to 15 percent of GDP at risk in climate-
       exposed regions within them by 2050.

     — Statistically expected damage to capital stock from riverine floods could double by
       2030 and rise fourfold from today’s levels by 2050; however, our estimates do not reflect
       the much larger impacts of other forms of flooding or other hazards (for example, tidal
       flooding, forest fires, and storm surge) given the challenges of modeling such an analysis
       globally.159 The statistically expected damage to capital stock from riverine floods as a
       percentage of capital stock in climate-exposed regions could increase from 0.15 percent
       today to 0.25 percent in 2050. This is the equivalent of an increase from $35 billion per
       year to $140 billion per year.

     — Share of time spent in drought over a decade across the 105 countries is expected to rise
       by 25 percent, from 8 percent today to 10 percent by 2050, according to our inherent
       risk assessment.160

     — Global agriculture yields could be subject to increased volatility, with a skew toward
       worse outcomes. The cumulative likelihood over a decade of at least one year with a
       greater than 10 percent annual increase in global yields occurring once in the decade
       could rise from zero percent today to 45 percent in the decade centered on 2050. At the
       same time, the cumulative likelihood of at least one year with a greater than 10 percent
       decrease occurring would increase from 45 percent today to 90 percent in that time.161 As
       we discuss below, these trends are not uniform across countries. While some could see
       improved agricultural yields, others could suffer negative impacts.

     — With temperature increases and precipitation changes, the biome in parts of the world
       is expected to shift.162 In our inherent risk assessment, the land area experiencing a shift
       in climate classification compared with a 1901–25 baseline is projected to increase from
       about 25 percent today to roughly 45 percent by 2050 (an increase from 30 million square
       kilometers today to 55 million square kilometers in 2050 in absolute terms).


     158
           The lower end of the range assumes that today’s sectoral composition persists, while the higher end is based on
           projections from IHS Markit Economics and Country Risk on sectoral transitions.
     159
           This analysis assumes sufficient adaptation against current 50- to 100‑year flooding events. Choice of adaptation levels
           were based on Paolo Scussolini, “FLOPROS: an evolving global database of flood protection standards,” Natural Hazards
           and Earth Systems Sciences, May 2016, Volume 16 and Philip J. Ward et al., “Assessing flood risk at the global scale:

           Global yields based on an analysis of six global breadbaskets that make up 70 percent of global production of four

           annual probabilities for the climate state in the 2030 period and the 2050 period, respectively. Annual probabilities
           are independent and can therefore be aggregated to arrive at a cumulative decadal probability. Yield anomalies here
           are measured relative to the 1998–2017 average yield. Yield anomalies here are measured relative to the 1998—2017
           average yield.
     162
           We have used changes in the Köppen Climate Classification System as an indicative proxy for shifts in biome. For
           example, tropical rainforests exist in a particular climatic envelope that is defined by temperature and precipitation
           characteristics. In many parts of the world, this envelope could begin to be displaced by a much drier “tropical savannah”
           climate regime that threatens tropical rainforests. Data taken from Franz Rubel and Markus Kottek, “Observed
           and projected climate shifts 1901–2100 depicted by world maps of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification,”

Livability and workability
As discussed in the India case, parts of South Asia are projected to become some of the
first places over the coming decades to experience heat waves that surpass the survivability
threshold for a healthy human being over the coming decades.163 We find a similar trend
in other regions. Under an RCP 8.5 scenario, we find that by 2030, the number of people
living in regions with a greater than zero percent annual probability of a lethal heat wave is
projected to increase from negligible today to between about 250 million and 360 million,
without factoring in air conditioner penetration. Today, air conditioner penetration is roughly
10 percent across India, and roughly 60 percent across China.164 This dramatic increase in
exposed regions, and thus population, is due to the sharp right-hand tail of the distribution of
wet-bulb temperatures. It takes a significant rightward (that is, higher) shift of the distribution
of wet-bulb temperatures before lethal heat waves are possible, but once they become
possible, the annual probability increases rapidly. The most heavily populated areas of the
world are usually also among the hottest and most humid, and these areas are becoming even
hotter and more humid.

For the 2030 period under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the average annual probability of a lethal
heat wave occurring is estimated to be roughly 9 percent across exposed regions (that is,
regions with a non-zero annual likelihood of such heat waves). Because this is an average
number across regions, some regions have higher probabilities and others have lower.165 The
average probability of a person living in an at-risk region experiencing such a lethal heat wave
occurring once in the decade centered on 2030 is estimate to be approximately 60 percent.166
By 2050, the number of people living in regions experiencing a non-zero likelihood of such
heat waves is projected to increase to between 700 million and 1.2 billion people, again
without factoring in air conditioner penetration. People living in such regions are projected to
have an average 14 percent annual probability of experiencing a lethal heat wave or a roughly
80 percent cumulative likelihood of experiencing such a heat wave at least once over a
decade centered 2050.

As discussed in our India case, heat and humidity could also affect labor productivity, with
workers needing to take more breaks and the human body naturally limiting its efforts to
prevent over-exertion. We measure this effect by considering the effective working hours
that could be at risk due to extreme heat and humidity in climate-exposed regions, a measure
of impacts on workability.167 We consider an “average year,” predicted based on the mean
of 20 climate models, as well as years that are “hotter and more humid than average” and
“colder and less humid than average.”168 Considering the impact on workability, we find that
today, about 10 percent of working hours are at risk globally due to conditions that reduce
labor productivity in heat- and humidity-exposed regions. This is expected to rise to between
10 and 15 percent by 2030 and 15 to 20 percent by 2050, with the range reflecting the
variation across years of different heat and humidity.




163
      See the discussion of how we define lethal heat waves in Chapter 2. If a non-zero probability of lethal heat waves in
      certain regions occurred in the models for today, this was set to zero to account for the poor representation of the high
      levels of observed atmospheric aerosols in those regions in the CMIP5 models. High levels of atmospheric aerosols
      provide a cooling effect that masks the risk. See India case for further details. This analysis excludes grid-cells where the
      the likelihood of lethal heat waves is <1 percent, to eliminate areas of low statistical significance.
164
      This estimate does not take into account current or future air-conditioning protection, and therefore should be viewed
      as an upper bound for exposure. India Cooling Action Plan Draft, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change,
      Government of India, September 2018; The Future of Cooling in China”, IEA, Paris, 2019.
165
      We calculate the average annual probability in climate-exposed geographies by first calculating the number of people
      that live in any part of the world with a greater than zero probability of a lethal heat wave occurring. We then calculate, for
      each geospatial grid-cell with a non-zero probability of lethal heat wave occurrence, the product of the probability of the
      lethal heat wave occurring and the number of people in that grid-cell. The average annual probability of a lethal heat wave
      in climate-exposed geographies is then the division of those two numbers.
166
      This calculation is a rough approximation. It assumes that the annual probability of X percent applies to every year in
      decade centered around 2030. We first calculate the cumulative probability of a heat wave not occurring in the 2030
      decade, which is 1 minus X percent raised to the power 10. The cumulative probability of a heat wave occurring at least
      once in the decade is then 1 minus that number. A similar approach is followed for the 2050 cumulative likelihood.
167
      This is the statistically expected number of hours that are lost in an average year. We consider the probability of different
      wet-bulb temperatures occurring, and the labor capacity lost at each temperature. See India case and technical appendix
      for details.
168
      Such years are calculated by looking at the 25th and 75th percentile ensemble projection.




Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                                             97


     As discussed in our India case, the slowdown in working hours and labor productivity will also
     affect output in outdoor-based sectors. For this geospatial analysis, we focus on the impact
     on three outdoor-based sectors: agriculture, construction, and mining.169 The effective hours
     available to work outdoors are reduced, which in turn—without adaptation action—would
     affect output of such sectors. This could then have knock-on effects on connected sectors.
     We looked at how GDP in our sample of 105 countries could be affected as a result. Given that
     these effects are spatially defined, we look at the impact of these effects on local economic
     activity in climate-exposed regions (here, this means heat- and humidity-exposed regions
     where wet-bulb temperatures are expected to rise).

     Across countries, we find that about 2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in climate-exposed regions
     could be at risk from decreased workability in specific sectors by 2050. This includes both
     the direct impact on relevant sectors and the knock-on effect on connected sectors.170 In an
     average year, between $4 trillion and $6 trillion in GDP could be at risk in 2050, up from about
     1.5 percent today.171 The pace of sectoral shifts in national economies will strongly influence
     GDP outcomes and drive the range in the GDP at risk. In many of the regions most exposed
     to impacts on labor productivity from heat, including India and Pakistan, a significant share
     of GDP currently derives from outdoor sectors like agriculture. If this share is reduced, less
     of the GDP of these countries will be at risk. We also find that there is a slightly greater skew
     downward on the range of potential impact: the GDP impact from heat and humidity in a
     colder-than-average year could be $600 billion to $950 billion lower than in the average year,
     while the impact of a hotter-than-average year could be $300 billion to $500 billion higher.172

     Impacts also vary significantly across countries, based on their exposure to heat and humidity
     as well as the sectoral makeup of their economies. Over time, we find that the share of GDP
     at risk from workability impacts is expected to increase in affected regions, and that more
     regions could be affected (Exhibits 22 and 23). For example, about a third of the countries
     we looked at could see 5 to 15 percent of GDP at risk in climate-exposed regions within them
     by 2050.

     Finally, as discussed in Chapter 2, water supply could also be affected across countries.173 This
     has consequences for water stress, the ratio of water demand to water supply. Assuming that
     demand for water stays at today’s levels, we found that, by 2050, 48 countries would see an
     increase in water stress relative to today’s levels, while 57 countries would see a decrease in
     water stress relative to today’s levels.174




     169
           See technical appendix for details on modeling approach.
     170
           We consider the impact of reduced labor productivity and lost working hours on three sectors: agriculture, mining, and
           construction. It is possible that in some countries, those same factors could affect other sectors (for example, labor-
           intensive manufacturing). We used backward multipliers from input-output tables to arrive at those knock-on effects.
     171
           The lower end of the range assumes that today’s sectoral composition persists, while the higher end is based on
           projections from IHS Markit Economics and Country Risk on sectoral transitions and GDP increases. The dollar impact
           is calculated by multiplying the share of hours lost in outdoor sectors with GDP in these sectors (this assumes that such
           consensus projections do not factor in losses to GDP from climate change).
     172
           We have previously described the skew of uncertainties in climate models to be upward, or toward worse outcomes; it is
           more likely that CO2 causes more warming globally than we are estimating, rather than less. However, this relationship
           does not necessarily hold when evaluating specific climate hazards that are influenced by that warming. For example,
           it does not hold when evaluating wet-bulb temperatures, whose upper bound is constrained by physics. As humidity
           rises, atmospheric dynamics entails that, beyond a certain point, the moisture in the air precipitates as rain. As a result,
           there is more “room to maneuver” on the lower bound than on the upper bound. This means that, assuming the global
           temperature increase modeled by the RCP 8.5 scenario is correct, uncertainty about wet-bulb temperatures skews
           toward the lower outcome. However, the global temperature increase has considerable upward uncertainty, and
           therefore the 75th-percentile outcomes could be more likely given a more aggressive change in global temperatures.
     173
           Based on data from the World Resources Institute Water Risk Atlas (2018), which relies on six underlying CMIP5 models..
     174
           We have assumed water demand is constant to allow us to isolate the impacts of a change climate only on water stress,
           and not the impacts of increased population and GDP growth.

                                      and soy.175 The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that the global annual
                                      production of these four crops today is 3.6 billion tonnes. With the changing climate, volatility
                                      is expected to increase. This will drive an increase in both risk of years with unusually low
                                      global production and the likelihood of unusually abundant bumper crop years. As discussed
                                      in the global breadbasket case, the likelihood of yield failures is expected to go up. The annual
                                      probability of a global greater than 10 percent reduction in yield in a given year is expected
                                      to increase from 6 percent today to 11 percent in 2030.176 In other words, the cumulative
                                      probability of such an event occurring at least once in the decade centered around 2030 is
                                      about 70 percent. At the same time, the annual probability of a global greater than 10 percent


                                      175
                                            Here, we follow a somewhat different approach than for other risk measures. Rather than doing this analysis across
                                            all 105 countries, we selected the largest producing breadbasket regions in each continent and analyzed changes
                                            to those regions. This was done because the AgMIP project, which is the underlying set of climate models used for
                                            this assessment, was designed to investigate global or regional changes in agricultural output, and not to do highly
                                            geospatially specific country-level analyses.
                                      176
                                            Yield increases and decreases here are compared to average yield between 1998 and 2017.

increase in yield in a given year is not expected to change meaningfully between now and
2030. By 2050, the annual probability of a greater than 10 percent reduction in yield in a given
year is expected to further increase to about 20 percent (or, is expected to occur a 90 percent
cumulative probability once in the decade centered around 2050) while the probability of a
greater than 10 percent increase in yield in a given year is expected to increase to 6 percent
(or, has about a 45 percent chance of occurring once in the decade centered around 2050).

Thus, our analysis suggests variability in both good and bad outcomes, although the volatility
is likely to be skewed toward worse outcomes. These shifts in agricultural output will affect
agricultural GDP. The tail GDP risk would increase over time as the likelihood of a global
reduction in production increases; moreover, the impact of diminished agricultural production
could also have knock-on effects through the economy, affecting food prices, consumption,
and downstream industries, as discussed in the breadbasket case.

Global findings also hide heterogenous regional trends: some regions are projected to
experience increases in statistically expected yields, while others are projected to experience
decreases. All regions are projected to experience an increase in volatility, but in some
regions that volatility would be skewed toward better outcomes, while in other regions the
skew would be toward worse outcomes. While we were not able to exhaustively investigate all
regions, we were able to identify some differing regional trends in the large producing parts of
the world. For example:

— North America. The United States on average is expected to experience net-negative
  consequences, with statistically expected yields decreasing and volatility skewed toward
  worse outcomes. By contrast, Canada is expected to see sharp increases in statistically
  expected yields. The United States is expected to see a greater than 10 percent decrease
  in statistically expected yields by 2050 compared with the 1998–2017 period, with the
  annual probability of a greater than 10 percent decrease in yield in a given year increasing
  from 20 percent today to 50 percent by 2050. The annual probability of a bumper year
  with a greater than 10 percent increase in yields relative to the 1998–2017 baseline is
  expected to increase from 0 percent to 6 percent. Canada is expected to see a 50 percent
  increase in statistically expected yields by 2050 relative to 1998–2017. The annual
  probability of a greater than 10 percent decrease in yields in a given year is expected to
  decrease from 16 percent today to 0 percent by 2050, and the annual probability of a
  greater than 10 percent bumper crop year is expected to increase from 17 percent today to
  98 percent by 2050.

— South America. South America is a climatologically diverse continent that experiences
  different agricultural outcomes in different regions. The largest single producer in
  the region is Brazil. Like the United States, Brazil is expected to suffer net-negative
  agricultural consequences from climate change, with both decreasing statistically
  expected yields and volatility skewed toward worse outcomes. Specifically, Brazil
  is expected to see a 3 percent decrease in statistically expected annual yields by
  2050 relative to 1998–2017. The annual probability of a greater than 10 percent yield
  decline in a given year compared with a 1998–2017 baseline would increase from
  3 percent today to 10 percent by 2050, whereas the probability of a 10 percent yield
  increase is not expected to change meaningfully.

— Europe. Europe and western Russia could together experience net agricultural benefits
  as a result of climate change, with increasing statistically expected yields, and an increase
  in volatility skewed toward more positive outcomes. However, risk of yield failures
  does increase through to 2050, and there are many differences within the region. The
  aggregate region of Europe and Russia is expected to experience a 4 percent increase in
  statistically expected yields by 2050 relative to 1998–2017. The annual probability of a
  greater than 10 percent yield failure compared with a 1998–2017 baseline would increase
  from 8 percent to 11 percent by 2050, while the annual probability of a bumper year with a
  greater than 10 percent yield increase would rise from 8 percent to 18 percent by 2050.

      — Asia–Pacific. China is expected to be an agricultural net beneficiary from climate
        change over the near term, with increasing statistically expected yields and volatility
        skewed toward positive outcomes. India, on the other hand, is expected to experience a
        net-negative agricultural impact from climate change. China could see expected yields
        increase by about 2 percent by 2050 relative to 1998–2017. The annual probability of
        greater than 10 percent breadbasket failure relative to a 1998–2017 baseline would
        decrease from 5 percent to 2 percent by 2050, while the annual probability of a bumper
        year with a greater than 10 percent increase in yield would increase from 1 percent to
        approximately 12 percent by 2050. India is expected to experience a 7 percent decrease
        in statistically expected crop yields by 2050, while the annual probability of a greater than
        10 percent decrease in yields in a given year would increase from 10 percent to 40 percent
        by 2050. The annual probability of greater than 10 percent increase in yields in a given
        year would decrease from 3 percent to 0 percent over the same period.

      Physical assets and infrastructure services
      As we found in our cases, assets can be destroyed or service from infrastructure assets
      disrupted by a variety of hazards including flooding, forest fires, hurricanes, and heat. Take
      flooding, for example. There are various forms of flooding, including riverine floods, flash
      floods, storm surge, and tidal flooding, all of which could damage capital stock. Due to data
      limitations, we were unable to examine the impacts of each of these on capital stock globally,
      but we specifically look at the impact of one hazard—riverine flooding—to illustrate how global
      capital stock could be affected by rising climate hazards.177 The approach we take in our cases
      assesses the evolution of hazard severity and frequency and then overlays that with data on
      capital stock exposure and capital stock resilience.

      Estimating capital stock damage from flooding is highly complex, and the numbers we
      give here should be taken as directional in their assessment of risk rather than as precise
      estimates.178 Moreover, it is important to recognize that such estimates are underestimates
      of the capital stock at risk of damage from a changing climate, since this represents only one
      specific hazard. Nonetheless, some important trends emerge. First, the growth in statistically
      expected damage to capital from riverine flooding is expected to rise steeply, from about
      $35 billion of capital stock every year globally today to about $60 billion by 2030 and
      $140 billion by 2050.179 This represents a 1.7-fold increase between today and 2030, and a
      fourfold increase between today and 2050. Impacts could be significantly higher than these
      numbers suggest, depending on the specific form of capital affected, such as infrastructure.
      This leads to various knock-on effects, as discussed in our infrastructure case.

      The numbers above represent statistical averages, and the impacts could be significantly
      higher in a given year if tail events manifest. This is similar to our finding in the Florida case,
      where our analysis shows that statistical average impacts on real estate from storm surge
      could increase from $2 billion to between $3 billion and $4.5 billion between today and 2050,
      but the impact of 1-in-100‑year storm surge events is substantially higher and could increase
      from $35 billion today to between $50 billion and $75 billion by 2050, an increase of 40 to
      110 percent.



      177
            We chose to analyze riverine flooding due to ease of global data availability.
      178
            This analysis is based on using riverine floodplain data from the World Resources Institute to identify today’s floodplains
            and data on increases in precipitation frequency to evaluate how flooding hazards could evolve. This approach therefore
            should be considered to be only an approximation of the evolution of flooding hazard, and it should be noted that a robust
            analysis of flooding will require the use of granular flood models. Further limitations of this analysis include the focus
            on riverine flooding only (versus tidal, flash, or pluvial flooding, or flooding from storm surge), the ability to identify flood
            protections globally in a robust way and therefore adjust for today’s level of adaptation, and the ability to identify damage
            functions for capital stock that are specific to an individual site, such as a given building or a factory, rather than rely on
            more general damage functions. See the technical appendix for modeling approach details.
      179
            This was calculated by using geospatial data on capital stock from UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk
            Reduction, assessing exposure of the capital stock to flood depths of different severity, and using regional vulnerability
            assessments from the European Commission Joint Research Center. We assume that capital stock today is adapted to
            withstand today’s 50- and 100‑year floods. We also assume capital stock increases going forward in line with today’s
            ratio of GDP and capital stock and based on consensus GDP projections from IHS Markit Economics and Country Risk.
            However, we assume that the geospatial breakdown of capital stock remains as today, given data limitations on obtaining
            time series estimates on how the geospatial breakdown of capital stock varies.

Other researchers have attempted similar estimates for hurricane damage and its potential
tail risks. For example, an analysis by the Cambridge Risk Studies Centre found that damage
caused by a tail risk hurricane in the eastern United States could potentially be more than
$1 trillion, because storms travel long distances and can make multiple landfalls. The
Cambridge Risk Studies Centre classifies such a tail hurricane event as a 1-in-200‑year event.
This could begin as a normal tropical system of low-pressure clouds and thunderstorms,
rapidly intensify upon entering the Gulf Stream, grow to a Category 4 hurricane in under six
hours, then make landfall in Florida with sustained winds of over 147 miles per hour. It could
move across the Gulf of Mexico and finally make second landfall near Santa Rosa Island, near
Pensacola, but with lower sustained winds of 127 miles per hour and at Category 3 intensity.
The Cambridge Risk Studies researchers expect recovery from the hurricane event would
take around a year and personal consumption would dip to 83 percent in the first quarter
after the disaster.180 Climate change contributes to the frequency of such hurricanes, the
Cambridge Risk Studies Centre finds.

Natural capital
With temperature increases and precipitation changes, the biome in many parts of the world
is expected to shift. The biome refers to the naturally occurring community of flora and
fauna inhabiting a particular region. For this report, we have used changes in the Köppen
Climate Classification System as an indicative proxy for shifts in biome.181 For example,
tropical rainforests exist in a particular climatic envelope that is defined by temperature
and precipitation characteristics. In many parts of the world this envelope could begin to be
displaced by a much drier “tropical savannah” climate regime, putting tropical rainforests at
risk of collapse. Today, 25 percent of the Earth’s land area has already experienced a shift in
climate classification compared with the 1901–25 period. By 2050, that number is expected
to increase to roughly 45 percent. All countries and their local species would be affected to
some degree, and in countries that rely on the natural environment, this could in particular
affect ecosystem services and local livelihoods.


By 2030, every country could see an increase in one of our six indicators
of potential impacts from a changing climate, with emerging economies
facing the biggest increase
Taking together a country view of the six indicators of potential climate impacts we examine—
the share of population living in areas experiencing a non-zero annual probability of lethal heat
waves, the share of outdoor working hours affected by extreme heat and humidity, the annual
demand of water as a share of annual supply of water, the share of time spent in drought
over a decade, the annual share of capital stock at risk of riverine flood damage in climate-
exposed regions, and the share of land surface changing climate classification—we find that
all 105 countries we studied would see an increase in the potential direct impacts from climate
change as indicated by at least one measure by 2030. This could then increase further to
2050, under an RCP 8.5 scenario and without adaptation. As noted earlier in the chapter,
16 countries could see an increase in three indicators by 2050 compared to today, while
44 countries see an increase in five of six indicators. Most countries are expected to see rising
impacts for the annual share of effective outdoor working hours affected by extreme heat and
humidity in climate-exposed regions, annual share of capital stock at risk of flood damage in
climate-exposed regions, and the share of land surface changing climate classification.

181
      Biome shift was measured using the Köppen climate classification system. The Köppen climate system divides climates
      into five main groups, with each group further subdivided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns.
      This is not a perfect system for assessing the location and composition of biomes; however, these two characteristics
      do correlate very closely with climate classification, and therefore this was assessed as a reasonable proxy for risk of
      disruptive biome changes.

      Broadly speaking, countries can be divided into six groups based on their patterns of change
      in direct impacts between now and 2050, under an RCP 8.5 scenario (Exhibits 24, 25,
      and 26).182

      — Significantly hotter and more humid countries. Hot and humid countries such as India
        and Pakistan are expected to become significantly hotter and more humid by 2050.
        Countries in this group are near the equator in Africa, Asia, and the Persian Gulf. They
        are characterized by extreme increases in heat and humidity impacts, that is, the loss of
        workability (an average roughly ten-percentage-point expected increase in annual share
        of effective outdoor working hours lost to extreme heat and humidity in heat-exposed
        regions between today and 2050 across the countries in this group) and a decrease
        in water stress. The livability risk that countries in this group face is especially large,
        because of the combination of heat and humidity. The share of the population of the
        countries in this group exposed to a non-zero chance of lethal heat waves between now
        and 2050 is expected to rise by roughly ten percentage points, with some differences
        among countries.

      — Hotter and more humid countries. This group includes the Philippines, Ethiopia, and
        Indonesia. These countries are typically between the equator and the 30-degree north
        and south lines of latitude. As with the previous group, they are characterized by an
        expected large increase in heat and humidity impacts to workability (with an average
        eight-percentage-point increase in annual share of effective outdoor working hours lost
        to extreme heat and humidity in climate-exposed regions between today and 2050 across
        the countries in this group), but likely do not become so hot or humid that they exceed
        livability thresholds. Water stress is also expected to decrease for these countries.

      — Hotter countries. This group includes Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
        and Malaysia. Many countries in this group are near the equator. They are characterized
        by a large increase in heat and humidity impacts to workability (with an average
        eight-percentage-point increase in annual share of effective outdoor working hours
        lost to extreme heat and humidity between today and 2050), but do not become so hot
        or humid as to pass livability thresholds. This group of countries is not expected to grow
        wetter, and some countries in this group could even become substantially drier and see
        increased water stress.

      — Increased water stress countries. This group includes Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Turkey. In
        these locations, Hadley cells (the phenomenon responsible for the atmospheric transport
        of moisture from the tropics, and therefore location of the world’s deserts) are expanding,
        and these countries face a projected reduction in rainfall, in an RCP 8.5 scenario.183 Some
        of the countries in this group intersect the 30-degree north or south line of latitude. They
        are characterized by a potentially large increase in water stress (with an average expected
        increase of about 47 percentage points in water stress between today and 2050 for
        the countries in this group), drought frequency (average expected increase of about
        11 percentage points of the share of time spent in drought over a decade), and among
        the largest increase in biome shift (average increase of about 27 percentage points in
        the share of land surface changing climate classification between today and 2050, as
        measured against a 1901—25 baseline.




      182
            These patterns were primarily based on looking at indicators relating to livability and workability, food systems, and
            natural capital. The annual share of capital stock at risk of riverine flood damage in climate-exposed regions indicator
            was considered but was not found to be the defining feature of any country, grouping aside from a lower-risk group of
            countries..

— Lower-risk increase countries. This group includes Germany, Russia, and the United
  Kingdom. Many countries in this group lie outside the 30-degree north and south lines
  of latitude. They are generally cold countries and characterized by very low levels of heat
  and humidity impacts to workability (with an average 0.5-percentage-point increase in
  the annual share of effective outdoor working hours lost to extreme heat and humidity
  in climate-exposed regions, and no livability risk). Many are expected to see a decrease
  in overall impacts from indicators such as water stress or time spent in drought. As
  these countries grow warmer, one of the biggest changes they are likely to see is a
  significant shift in biome, for example as the polar and boreal climates retreat poleward
  and disappear. This group is expected to see the largest increase in biome change (about
  40 percentage points average increase in the land surface changing climate classification
  between today and 2050, measured against a 1901—25 baseline. Another change that
  many of these countries could experience is an increase in the share of capital stock at
  risk of riverine flood damage in climate-exposed regions.

— Diverse climate countries. The final group consists of countries that span a large range
  of latitudes and therefore are climatically heterogeneous. Examples include Argentina,
  Brazil, Chile, China, and the United States.184 While average numbers may indicate
  small risk increases, these numbers mask wide regional variations. The United States,
  for example, has a hot and humid tropical climate in the Southeast, which could see
  significant increases in heat and humidity risk to outdoor work in our inherent risk scenario
  but is not projected to see increased water stress. The West Coast region, by contrast,
  is not expected to see a big increase in heat and humidity risk to outdoor work, but it is
  projected to have increased impacts from water stress and drought. In Alaska, the primary
  risk will likely be the shifting boreal biome affecting natural capital and the attendant
  ecosystem disruptions. To understand the climate risks facing diverse climate countries,
  one must examine the different regions independently.




184
      To some extent, many countries could experience diversity of risk within their boundaries, a key feature of climate risk
      which is spatial. Here we have focused on highlighting countries with large climatic variations, and longitudinal expanse,
      which drives different outcomes in different parts of the country.

1. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen
   because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects
   could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of
   atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.
2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
Note: See the Technical Appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

Countries and regions with lower per capita GDP levels are generally more at risk. Poorer
regions often have climates that are closer to physical thresholds. They rely more on outdoor
work and natural capital and have fewer financial means to adapt quickly, meaning that they
could be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.185 Climate change could also
benefit some countries; for example, crop yields in Canada, Russia, and parts of Northern
Europe could improve.

The risk associated with the impact on workability from rising heat and humidity is one
example of how poorer countries are more exposed to hazards (Exhibit 27). When looking at
the workability indicator (that is, the annual share of effective outdoor working hours lost to
extreme heat and humidity), the top quartile of countries (based on GDP per capita) have an
average increase in risk by 2050 of approximately one to three percentage points, whereas
the bottom quartile faces an average increase in risk of approximately five to ten percentage
points. Lethal heat waves show less of a correlation with per capita GDP, but it is important
to note that several of the most affected countries, under an RCP 8.5 scenario, including
Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, have relatively low per capita GDP levels. Such countries
are close to physical thresholds particularly for heat and humidity impacts on workability
and livability.

Biome shift is expected to affect northern and southern latitude countries. Since many of
these countries have higher per capita GDP levels, this indicator shows a positive correlation
with development levels.




185
      Note that this could also be true at a sub-national level; specific regions and communities could be more vulnerable than
      others within a country.

Our global geospatial analysis illustrates that current and future climate risk is pervasive
across the world, with all 105 countries we studied experiencing an increase in at least one
risk indicator by 2030. As we have highlighted in this report, sizing that risk is a complex task
that requires an analysis of both statisticially expected and tail risks, of direct impacts to the
stock of human, physical, and natural capital as well as to flows of GDP activity and other
knock-on effects. Given these uncertainties and risks, how should decision makers respond?
In the next chapter, we look at steps for stakeholders seeking an effective response to the
challenges of a changing climate and the risks that it entails.

5. An effective response
  Physical climate risk will affect everyone, directly or indirectly. Responding to it adequately
  will require careful translation of climate science into specific risk assessments, at a time
  when old models of assessing and managing risk are losing their relevance. As we have noted
  in this report, physical and socioeconomic impacts of climate change are characterized by the
  growing likelihood of long tail events occurring that could result in cascading systemic risks.

  In this final chapter, we discuss three steps that stakeholders could consider as they seek an
  effective response to the socioeconomic impacts of physical climate risk: integrating climate
  risk into decision making, accelerating the pace and scale of adaptation, and decarbonizing at
  scale to prevent a further buildup of risk.


  Integrating climate risk into decision making
  Much as thinking about information systems and cyber-risks has become integrated into
  corporate and public sector decision making, climate change will also need to feature as a
  major factor in decisions. As we have noted, physical climate risk is simultaneously spatial and
  systemic, non-stationary, and can result in nonlinear impacts. We find potential impacts to be
  rising over time across our cases and regressive; moreover, stakeholders today may be under-
  prepared to manage its impact. Decision making will need to reflect these characteristics. For
  companies, this will mean taking climate considerations into account when looking at capital
  allocation, development of products or services, and supply-chain management, among
  others. For example, large capital projects could be evaluated reflecting the full probability
  distribution of possible climate hazards at their location. This would include changes in
  that probability distribution over time and possible changes in cost of capital for exposed
  assets, as well as how climate risk could affect the broader market context and other implicit
  assumptions in the investment case. For cities, a climate focus will become essential for urban
  planning decisions. Moreover, while this report has focused on physical risk, a comprehensive
  risk management strategy will also need to include an assessment of transition and liability
  risk, and the interplay between these forms of risk.

  Developing a robust quantitative understanding of climate risk is complex, for the many
  reasons outlined in this report. It requires the use of new tools, metrics, and analytics.
  Companies and communities are beginning to assess their exposure to climate risk, but
  much more needs to be done. Lack of understanding significantly increases risks and
  potential impacts across financial markets, and socioeconomic systems, for example, by
  driving capital flows to risky geographies, or increasing the likelihood of stakeholders being
  caught unprepared.

  At the same time, opportunities from the changing climate will emerge and require
  consideration. These could arise from a change in the physical environment, such as new
  places for agricultural production, or for sectors like tourism, as well as through the use of new
  technologies and approaches to manage risk in a changing climate.

      Changes in mind-set, operating model, and tools and processes will be needed to integrate
      climate risk into decision making effectively. Decision makers’ experiences are based on a
      world of relative climate stability, and they may not yet be planning for a world of changing
      climate. For example, statistical risk management is often not part of ordinary processes
      in industrial companies. With the changing climate, it will be important to understand and
      embrace the probabilistic nature of climate risk and be mindful of possible biases and
      outdated mental models; experiences and heuristics of the past are often no longer a
      reliable guide to the future. The systemic nature of climate risk requires a holistic approach
      to understand and identify the full range of possible direct and indirect impacts. The spatial
      nature of hazard means that decision making will need to incorporate a geographic dimension.

      One of the biggest challenges from climate risk could be to rethink the current models we use
      to quantify risk. These range from financial models used to make capital allocation decisions,
      to engineering models used to design structures. As we have discussed, some uncertainty
      is associated with a methodology that leverages global and regional climate models, makes
      underlying assumptions on emissions paths, and seeks to translate climate hazards to
      potential physical and financial damages. The highest “model risk,” however, may not come
      from exploring new ways to quantify climate risk. Instead, it may derive from continued
      reliance on current models that are based on stable historical climate and economic data.
      These models have at least three potential flaws:

      — The absence of geographic granularity. Most models do not take into account geospatial
        dimensions. As this report highlights, direct impacts of climate change are local in
        nature. This requires an understanding of the exposure to risk via geospatial analysis. For
        example, companies will need to understand how their global asset footprint is exposed to
        different forms of current and evolving climate hazard in each one of their main locations—
        and indeed in each of the main locations of their critical suppliers.

      — The “non-stationarity,” or constant state of change, of the climate. For example, our entire
        capital stock is built around physical assumptions that may well be obsolete as relevant
        climate variables have already changed and continue to change. As a result, assumptions
        based on historical precedent and experience will need to be rethought. That could
        include, for example, how resilient to make new factories, what tolerance levels to employ
        in new infrastructure, and how to design urban areas.

      — Potential sample bias could prove to be a flaw. Decision makers often rely on their own
        experiences as a frame for decision making; in a changing climate, this may result in an
        incorrect assessment of future risk.

          A transformation in operating model could mean optimizing for resiliency rather than
          simply for efficiency. For example, it may be preferable to rent rather than own fixed
          assets. Companies may need to think about ways to increase resilience in supply chains,
          for example, by raising inventory levels or sourcing from multiple locations or suppliers.
          Resilience will need to be incorporated into capital design, and owners of well-functioning
          assets will need to maintain them proactively rather than waiting to repair damages.

      Adequate tools, metrics, and processes will vary by stakeholder but will likely include
      transitioning from a reliance on historical data or “worst case” expectations based on
      experience to relying on climate modeling tools to prepare for the future, including building
      new analytics capabilities. The process of managing climate change incorporates a full risk
      diagnostic as the basis for an appropriate response strategy.

Accelerating the pace and scale of adaptation
Societies have been adapting to the changing climate, but the pace and scale of adaptation
will likely need to increase significantly. Key adaptation measures include protecting people
and assets, building resilience, reducing exposure, and ensuring that appropriate insurance
and financing are in place.

Implementing adaptation measures could be challenging for many reasons. With hazard
intensity projected to increase, the economics of adaptation could worsen over time and there
may eventually be technical or other limits to effective adaptation. In other instances, there
could be difficult trade-offs that need to be assessed, including who and what to protect, and
who and what to relocate.

In some instances, coordinated action across multiple stakeholders may be required. This
may include establishing building codes and zoning regulations, mandating insurance or
disclosures, mobilizing capital through risk-sharing mechanisms, sharing best practices
across industry groups, and driving innovation. This could be done, for example, by providing
tools to integrate climate risk into investment decisions, integrating diverse perspectives
including those of different generations into decision making, and addressing the inequalities
that climate risk could amplify.

Protecting people and assets
Protecting people is crucial. Steps can range from prioritizing emergency response and
preparedness to erecting cooling shelters and adjusting working hours for outdoor workers
exposed to heat. For example, the Ahmedabad City Corporation developed the first heat-
action plan in India in response to the record-breaking 2010 heat wave that killed 300 people
in a single day.186 As part of the plan, Ahmedabad has implemented programs to build the
population’s awareness of the dangers of extreme heat. These measures include establishing
a seven-day probabilistic heat-wave early-warning system, developing a citywide cool-roofs
albedo management program, and setting up teams to distribute cool water and rehydration
tablets to vulnerable populations during heat waves.187

Measures to harden existing infrastructure and assets to the extent possible can help limit
risk. Hardening of infrastructure could include both “gray” infrastructure—for example,
raising elevation levels of buildings in flood-prone areas—and natural capital or “green”
infrastructure. One example of this is the Dutch Room for the River program, which gives
rivers more room to manage higher water levels.188 Mangroves can also provide storm
protection. A systemwide approach to protecting people and assets will be needed. For
example, even as homes may need to be floodproofed, so too could the roadways near
those homes.

Factoring decisions about protection into new buildings could be more cost-effective than
retrofitting.189 For example, infrastructure systems or factories could be designed to withstand
what used to be a one in 200‑year event. With a changing climate, what constitute such an
event may look different, and design parameters may need to be reassessed. Estimates
suggest that $30 trillion to $50 trillion will be spent on infrastructure in the next ten years,
much of it in developing countries.190 Given the lifetime of the assets, new infrastructure will

      Albedo refers to the reflectivity of a surface. Increasing the albedo of a city—through, for example, painting dark surfaces
      white—reduces temperature by reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed. Thomas R. Knutson, Fanrong Zeng, and

      need to be built with an eye to the future and factor in future climate hazards. This will also
      require reassessing engineering and building standards.

      Building resilience
      Decisions on asset hardening will need to go hand-in-hand with measures to drive operational
      resilience in systems. An important aspect of this is understanding the impact thresholds for
      systems and how they could be breached. This will help inform how to make systems more
      resilient and robust in a world of rising climate hazard. Examples of resilience planning include
      building global inventory to mitigate risks of food and raw material shortages or building
      inventory levels in supply chains to protect against interrupted production and establishing
      the means to source from alternate locations and/or suppliers. Back-up power sources could
      be established in case there are power failures.

      Reducing exposure
      Given the long lifetimes of many physical assets, the full life cycle will need to be considered
      and reflected in any adaptation strategy. For example, it may make sense to invest in asset
      hardening for the next decade but also to shorten asset life cycles. In subsequent decades,
      as climate hazards intensify, the cost-benefit equation of physical resilience measures may
      no longer be attractive. In that case, it may become necessary to relocate and redesign
      asset footprints altogether. Climate risk will need to be embedded in all capital expenditure
      decisions to minimize new exposure.

      In some instances, it may also be necessary to gradually reduce exposure by relocating assets
      and communities in regions that may be too difficult to protect. These are often hard choices;
      for example, the impact on individual home owners and communities needs to be weighed
      against the rising burden of repair costs and post-disaster aid, which affects all taxpayers.
      We have already seen some examples, including buyout programs in Canada for residents
      in flood-prone areas. Since 2005, Quebec has prohibited both the building of new homes
      and the rebuilding of damaged homes in the 20‑year floodplain.191 In Canada and elsewhere,
      homes damaged beyond a particular threshold will require mandatory participation in such
      programs. Decisions will need to be made about when to focus on protecting people and
      assets versus finding ways to reduce exposure to hazard, what regions and assets to spend
      on, how much to spend on adaptation, and what to do now versus in the future. This will
      require being able to conduct appropriate cost-benefit analyses that include a long-term
      perspective on how risk and adaptation costs will likely evolve, as well as integrating voices of
      affected communities into decision making.

      Equally important will be to support socioeconomic development in ways that recognize
      the risk of a changing climate. Continuing to shift the basis of economic development from
      outdoor work to urban indoor environments in extreme heat-prone environments and
      factoring climate risk into urban planning are examples.

Insurance and finance
Researchers estimate that only 50 percent of losses today are insured, a condition known as
underinsurance. Underinsurance may grow worse as more extreme events unfold, because
fewer people carry insurance for them. Insurance models suggest that if extreme events
with an exceedance probability of 1 percent manifest, underinsurance could be as high as
60 percent; for 0.4 percent probability events, the figure is 70 percent.192

While insurance cannot eliminate risk from a changing climate, it is a crucial shock absorber
to help manage risk. Without insurance as a shock absorber, recovery after disaster becomes
harder and knock-on effects more likely.193 Underinsurance or lack of insurance thus
reduces resilience. Appropriate insurance can also encourage behavioral changes among
stakeholders by sending appropriate risk signals—for example, to homeowners buying real
estate, lenders providing loans, and real estate investors financing real estate build-out.

Instruments such as parametrized insurance and catastrophe bonds can provide protection
against climate events, minimizing financial damage and allowing speedy recovery
after disasters. These products may help protect vulnerable populations that may find
it challenging to afford to rebuild after disasters. Insurance can also be a tool to reduce
exposure by transferring risk (for example, crop insurance allows transferring the risk of yield
failure due to drought) and drive resilience (such as by enabling investments in irrigation
and crop-management systems for rural populations who would otherwise be unable to
afford this).

However, as the climate changes, insurance might need to be further adapted to continue
providing resilience and, in some cases, avoid potentially adding vulnerability to the system.
For example, current levels of insurance premiums and levels of capitalization among insurers
may well prove insufficient over time for the rising levels of risk; and the entire risk transfer
process (from insured to insurer to reinsurer to governments as insurers of last resort) and
each constituents’ ability to fulfil their role may need examination. Without changes in risk
reduction, risk transfer, and premium financing or subsidies, some risk classes in certain areas
may become harder to insure, widening the insurance gap that already exists in some parts of
the world without government intervention.

Innovative approaches will also likely be required to help bridge the underinsurance gap.
Premiums are already sometimes subsidized—one example is flood insurance, which is
often nationally provided and subsidized. Such support programs however might need to be
carefully rethought to balance support to vulnerable stakeholders with allowing appropriate
risk signals in the context of growing exposure and multiple knock-on effects. One answer
might be providing voucher programs to help ensure affordability for vulnerable populations,
while maintaining premiums at a level that reflects the appropriate risk. Careful consideration
will need to be given to the provision of insurance in particularly risky areas to prevent moral
hazard (for example, continuing to rebuild in flood-prone areas, with rising damage costs and
adaptation need). In the United Kingdom, the government and insurers have established a
joint initiative, the UK Flood Re program, to provide affordable flood insurance. Premiums are
linked to council tax bands to ensure that support is targeted to those most in need. In the
long run, it is expected to transition to a private flood insurance program for which premiums
appropriately reflect flood risk. For now, the initiative allows home owners sufficient time to
put adaptation measures in place to protect themselves and keep their insurance premiums
affordable after Flood Re coverage ends.194

Insurance may also need to overcome a duration mismatch; for example, homeowners may
expect long-term stability for their insurance premiums, whereas insurers may look to reprice

      annually in the event of growing hazards and damages. This could also apply to physical
      supply chains that are currently in place or are planned for the future, as the ability to insure
      them affordably may become a factor of growing significance. Trade-offs between private
      and public insurance, and for individuals, between when to self-insure or buy insurance, will
      need to be carefully evaluated. In addition, underwriting may need to shift to drive greater
      risk reduction in particularly vulnerable areas (for example, new building codes or rules
      around hours of working outside). This is analogous to fire codes that emerged in cities in
      order to make buildings insurable. In other words, to be insured you had to meet certain
      underwriting requirements.

      Mobilizing finance to fund adaptation measures, particularly in developing countries, is
      also crucial. This may require public-private partnerships or participation by multilateral
      institutions, to prevent capital flight from risky areas once climate risk is appropriately
      recognized. Innovative products and ventures have been developed recently to broaden
      the reach and effectiveness of these measures. They include “wrapping” a municipal bond
      into a catastrophe bond, to allow investors to hold municipal debt without worrying about
      hard-to-assess climate risk. Governments of developing nations are increasingly looking to
      insurance and reinsurance carriers and other capital markets to improve their resiliency to
      natural disasters as well as give assurances to institutions that are considering investments in
      a particular region.


      Decarbonization at scale
      An assessment and roadmap for decarbonization is beyond the scope of this report. However,
      climate science and research by others tells us that the future of Earth’s climate after the
      next decade is dependent on the cumulative amount of carbon dioxide that is added to
      the atmosphere. Considering current emissions and greenhouse-gas-reduction pledges,
      scientists predict that the global average temperature will increase by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius
      relative to preindustrial average by the end of the century.195 Multiple lines of evidence suggest
      that physical feedback loops could further amplify human-caused warming, causing the
      planet to warm for hundreds or thousands of years independent of human action (such as the
      thawing of permafrost leading to the release of significant amounts of greenhouse gases).
      This could push the Earth into a much warmer “hothouse” state.196

      Scientists estimate that restricting warming to below 2.0 degrees would reduce the risk of
      initiating many serious feedback loops, and restricting it to 1.5 degrees would reduce the risk
      of initiating most of them.197 Because warming is a function of cumulative emissions, there is
      a specific amount of CO2 that can be emitted before reaching the 1.5-degree or 2.0-degree
      threshold (a “carbon budget”).198 Scientists estimate that the remaining 2.0-degree carbon
      budget will be exceeded in approximately 25 years and the remaining 1.5 degree carbon
      budget in 12 years, given the current annual emissions trajectory.199 To halt further warming
      would require reaching net zero emissions.

Hence, prudent risk management would suggest limiting future cumulative emissions
to minimize the risk of activating these feedback loops. While decarbonization is not
the focus of this research, decarbonization investments will need to be considered in
parallel with adaptation investments, particularly in the transition to renewable energy.
Stakeholders should consider assessing their decarbonization potential and opportunities
from decarbonization. While adaptation is now urgent and there are many adaptation
opportunities, climate science tells us that further warming and risk increase can only be
stopped by achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions.




Recognizing physical climate risk and integrating an understanding of this risk into decision
making is an imperative for individuals, businesses, communities, and countries. The next
decade will be decisive, as decision makers fundamentally rethink the infrastructure, assets,
and systems of the future, and the world collectively sets a path to manage the risk from
climate change.

Technical appendix
This report seeks to provide an understanding of how climate hazards can create risk. In this
technical appendix, we outline our key assumptions and approach (Exhibit A1).

Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC) performed most of the climatological analysis for this
report, and senior scientists at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute
independently reviewed the methodological design. All final design choices and interpretation
of climate hazard results were made by WHRC.

From the outset, it is important to understand the distinction between weather and climate.
Weather is defined as the behavior of the atmosphere with respect to temperature, wind
speed, cloudiness, and precipitation for a given location over a short period such as a day
or a week. Climate is defined as the statistical or probabilistic summary of weather patterns
over time and space. As a result, climate is possible to predict with reasonably high reliability,
whereas weather is not predictable more than two weeks in advance, due to the theoretical
constraints of modeling chaotic systems.1 Throughout this report, we consider only expected
changes in climate. We generally do this over two periods: the present to 2030, and the
present to 2050 (in some instances, we also consider other periods in our case studies,
and highlight where we do so) . Following standard practice, we define future states as the
average climatic behavior over multiple-decade periods. The climate state today is typically
defined as the average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as the average between
2021 and 2040, and in 2050 as the average between 2041 and 2060.2

      How global climate hazard is estimated
      The specific projections in this report were derived from climate models. Climate models
      are complex computational models based on physics that simulate the atmosphere, ocean,
      land, biosphere, and cryosphere down to resolutions of roughly 100km-by-100km. The
      climate models used in this report are drawn from an ensemble of 60 climate models known
      as general circulation models (GCMs) or earth system models; they are developed, owned,
      and operated independently by 28 leading scientific research institutions across the world. 3
      The World Climate Research Programme brought these models together to run standardized
      experiments to determine the likely outcome of various rates of carbon emissions in an
      undertaking known as CMIP5: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5. 4 The results of the
      CMIP5 ensemble are the most widely used source of climate projections in climate research
      today and have been evaluated in more than 1,500 papers. 5

      We also drew on projections from an ensemble of regional climate models, which are dynamic
      models that take GCM input and refine it to simulate specific regions of the globe at a finer
      resolution. This allows scientists to more accurately investigate future climates in regions
      with complex terrain. For the analyses in this report, we use projections from the Coordinated
      Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) ensemble.6 The CORDEX ensemble consists of
      80 regional climate models developed at 51 research institutions, using the CMIP5 ensemble
      or parts thereof as input data.7

      When modeling the response of agricultural systems to climate change, we drew from an
      ensemble of coupled climate and agricultural models known as AgMIP, which is coordinated
      by the Columbia University Earth Institute in partnership with multiple other organizations
      including NASA, USDA, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Studies, and others. 8
      Finally, we also sometimes rely on projections from external sources (for example, the World
      Resources Insitute on water stress).

      When making climate projections, we used the multimodel ensemble mean or median
      projection (depending on the requirements of the specific analysis)—in other words, the
      average projection across all selected models—because it has been proven both theoretically
      and empirically that using the average result across the full ensemble of models gives the
      most accurate projection.9

          Every model in the ensemble performs best at representing some aspect of the climate system, and no model performs
          best across all aspects, and therefore all models add some measure of skill to the multimodel projection. Furthermore,
          combining multiple models leads to cancellations of nonsystematic errors.

Emissions pathways and pace of warming
Climate impact research has inherent uncertainties and as a result makes extensive use
of scenarios. One particular input around which scenarios are frequently constructed is
atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Projections of future climate must be based upon an
assumed trajectory for future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Because future
human emissions of greenhouse gases are inherently unpredictable, the climate community
has developed a set of four standardized scenarios for future atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). 10 They outline
different atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration trajectories between 2005 and
2100 that roughly range from lower (RCP2.6) to higher (RCP 8.5) CO2 concentrations. During
their inception, RCPs were designed to collectively sample the range of then-probable future
emission pathways. Each RCP was created by an independent modeling team and there is
no consistent design of the socioeconomic parameter assumptions used in the derivation of
the RCPs.

Uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emissions is a key contributor to long-term (for
example, end-of-century) uncertainty in future temperatures but is less important on the
shorter time horizons (out to 2050) considered in this report. As we discuss in detail in
Chapter 2, warming during the next decade is determined largely by past emissions and by
physical inertia in the climate system. Beyond the next decade, warming is primarily a function
of cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Because decarbonization takes time, even a
scenario of targeted decarbonization action will result in significant cumulative emissions over
the next three decades. Climate simulations driven by the four RCP scenarios show a small
divergence in warming over the next two decades, and a moderate divergence by 2050 (see
also Exhibit 1, which shows projected warming for RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5; the two RCPs that
are most commonly used in climate models, to provide a sense of the spread in scenarios).11

We rely on RCP 8.5 for the analyses in this report. RCP 8.5 was created to model a case of no
further climate action and relatively higher rates of baseline greenhouse gas emissions. We
have chosen to focus on RCP 8.5, because the higher-emission scenario it portrays enables
us to assess physical risk in the absence of further decarbonization.

While RCP 8.5 has been criticized for assuming unrealistically high use of coal and thus
projecting too-high emissions in the second half of the century, we only consider a timeframe
out to 2050, and we adopted RCP 8.5 as a best available description for an ‘inherent risk’
scenario over the next two to three decades.12

      Three points to note about this choice are:

      — Since the starting point of the RCPs in 2005, RCP 8.5 has most closely tracked actual
        greenhouse gas emissions (and going forward, RCP 8.5 is broadly consistent with a
        continuation of the emissions trend of the last decade).13 As a result, it best matches
        current CO2 concentrations, whereas the other RCPs assume lower CO2 concentrations
        than observed.

      — Changes in the relative cost of renewable and fossil energy sources are forecast to
        lead to a moderate downward divergence from the historic trendline of energy-related
        CO2 emissions over the coming decades, even in absence of further decarbonization
        policies.14 In contrast, emissions from biotic feedbacks, such as permafrost thaw or
        increasing wildfires, are expected to increase. These feedbacks are not considered in
        the current generation of CMIP5 models and need to be accounted for exogenously.
        According to a recent review of the literature on biotic feedbacks, in the near term these
        feedbacks are estimated to reduce the 1.5 degree Celsius carbon budget by 100 GtCO2,
        and 2 degree Celsius carbon budget by 150 GtCO2.15

      — Early results from the next generation of climate models, CMIP6, suggest that the climate
        system may be more sensitive to CO2 than the current generation of models (CMIP5) used
        here, suggesting that the CMIP5 models may tend to underestimate future warming.16

      Based upon these considerations we chose to employ RCP 8.5 as a base case for considering
      2030 to 2050. Were this study investigating the risk outlook for 2100, we would consider
      multiple emissions pathways, but for the next three decades, we consider RCP 8.5 to be the
      best guide for understanding inherent risk.

      Restricting warming to below two degrees, the goal of the 2015 Paris agreement, would
      mean reaching net-zero emissions in the next 40 to 50 years. If this were achieved, the impact
      estimates presented in this report would likely not manifest to their full extent. Alternately,
      a decarbonization approach somewhere between business-as-usual and a two-degree-
      compliant pathway would mean that temperatures in 2050 would be below the roughly
      2 degrees Celsius increase reflected in the RCP 8.5 scenario, but that such temperature
      increases would be reached at some point post-2050. This means that the impact
      assessments presented in this report would manifest but only after 2050; it would push the
      2050 impacts further back into the second half of the century but would not prevent them.

      Another way to frame this would be that if we were to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius,
      our 2050 impact estimates would be the most severe impacts we would be expected to
      see (but at some point after 2050), and if we were to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,
      correspondingly our 2030 impact estimates would be the most severe impacts we would be
      expected to see (but at some point after 2030). For example, RCP 8.5 predicts global average
      warming of 2.3 degrees Celsius by 2050, compared with 1.8 for RCP 4.5. Under RCP 4.5,
      2.3 degrees Celsius warming would be reached in the year 2080.17

How climate hazard in a region of interest is estimated
Throughout this report, we seek to answer specific questions about future climate variables
for a particular region. Since GCMs tend to apply at continental or global scale, we needed
a tool for regional or subregional climate projections.18 At times, the CORDEX ensemble
of regional climate models was used instead of CMIP5 (a process known as dynamical
downscaling), and at other times a statistical process known as bias correction and spatial
disaggregation was performed. Both methodologies have been proven to increase the skillful
resolution of GCM projections to facilitate regional climate study.19 Some questions required
additional methodology. For example, “What is the probability of a heat wave of severity X
occurring in a given year in region Y?” To quantify the probability, the scientists with whom we
collaborated used a process known as bootstrapping to generate probability distributions
drawn from the full ensemble of bias corrected models.20

How we determine physical climate risk from climate hazard
Our approach to determine physical climate risk assesses direct impacts from climate change,
knock-on effects, and describes adaptation measures to avoid impacts (Exhibit A1). The
magnitude of risk from physical climate change depends on the following:

1. Direct impact: The magnitude of direct impact of climate change depends on three
   factors: the magnitude of the climate hazard and the probability of its occurrence;
   how much assets, population, and economic activity are exposed to the hazard; and to
   what degree they are vulnerable to the hazard when exposed (direct impact = hazard
   x exposure x vulnerability). To assess impacts, we typically look at hazards of different
   severity. For each of our cases, and for our country risk assessment, we identify how
   hazard and exposure to that hazard could evolve. For case studies, exposure was
   typically assumed to grow in line with expected trends (for example, for India, including
   continued sectoral shift of the economy and increasing penetration of air-conditioning).
   For our geospatial assessment, similarly we assumed increases in population or GDP
   trends. However, for this analysis, we assumed that geospatial distribution of these
   variables stays constant over time because of data limitations with geospatial time series
   data. We also assess the vulnerability of each system to a hazard through identifying
   appropriate “damage functions”—for example, how damage to capital stock varies based
   on floods of different depths. Damage functions are obtained from published academic
   literature or external data sources. We consider three broad types of damage functions:
   physiological (e.g., impact on human productivity from heat stress), ecological (e.g., impact
   on agricultural productivity from drought), and physical (e.g., vulnerability of buildings to
   floods). We identify five types of systems directly impacted by climate hazards: livability
   and workability, food systems, physical assets, infrastructure services, and natural capital.
   Collectively, this points to how climate change could affect economic output, capital stock,
   and lives.

Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                                                     127


          Impacts from climate change can be large, and potentially nonlinear, when climate hazards
          breach certain system thresholds. For example, the human body functions normally at a
          stable core temperature of about 37 degrees Celsius. The core temperature needs to rise
          only by 0.06 degree to compromise task performance, 3 degrees to induce dangerous
          heatstroke, and 5 degrees to cause death. As part of our analysis, we examine operational
          thresholds for physical, social, and economic systems in our case studies to determine
          potential impact.

      2. Knock-on impact: Local climate risk can spread through interconnected social, financial,
         and economic systems such as trade in goods and services. Knock-on effects can
         be large if the direct impacts of climate change affect a sector that is vital to the local,
         regional, or global economy. Knock-on effects can also be large for sectors that are
         long term in nature, such as real estate and infrastructure, because risk is amplified
         beyond the immediate effects of today’s damages. Real estate prices, for example,
         reflect expectations of the future. As buyers and sellers recognize future climate risk and
         the potential for future damages to homes, this may affect today’s prices, thus “pulling
         forward” future damages. To calculate these knock-on impacts, we first identify potential
         channels by which risk could spread or be amplified. Where feasible, we then attempt to
         size such impacts, primarily relying on historical precedents or empirical estimates to help
         assess the potential magnitude of impact. For example, to assess the knock-on effect of
         disruption of food systems, we assess how those failures could reduce food storage levels
         and take into account historical trends on the link between reduced food storage levels
         and food price increases. Some knock-on effects, such as abrupt repricing of financial
         assets in response to climate risk, could potentially be destabilizing in nature, but the
         triggers and magnitude of such effects are challenging to estimate, and we do not attempt
         to size these impacts. Our assessment of knock-on effects is likely not exhaustive given
         the complexities associated with socioeconomic systems.

      3. Adaptation costs: We define adaptation broadly to include protecting people and assets,
         building resilience, reducing exposure to hazard, and insurance and finance. We first
         examine inherent risk, assuming there is no significant increase in adaptation efforts, and
         that exposure continues to increase at historical rates, and vulnerability to risk remains the
         same as today. Then we explore adaptation measures, and where feasible, costs needed
         to adapt to climate risk, including exposure reduction where appropriate.

                                     Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts                            129


      How we selected our case studies and performed the global geospatial risk analysis
      In order to link physical climate risk to socioeconomic impact, we investigate nine specific
      cases that illustrate exposure to climate change extremes and proximity to physical
      thresholds. To select our case studies, we considered over 30 potential combinations of
      climate hazards, sectors, and geographies based on a review of the literature and expert
      interviews on the potential direct impacts of physical climate hazards. We find these hazards
      affect five different key socioeconomic systems: livability and workability, food systems,
      physical assets, infrastructure services, and natural capital. We ultimately chose nine cases
      to reflect these systems and based on their exposure to the extremes of climate change and
      their proximity today to key physiological, human-made, and ecological thresholds. As such,
      these cases represent leading-edge examples of climate change risk. For each case, we used
      the approach described above to quantify the inherent direct and knock-on risk from climate
      change, as well as outline a possible adaptation response.

      For the global geospatial risk assessment, we began with the full set of 195 member countries
      of the United Nations, and then removed 90 of those due to their small geographic size, in
      order to account for the fact that GCMs' predictive skill decreases with spatial resolution.
      Therefore, we analyzed 105 countries against six indicators that cover the five socio-
      economic systems impact by climate change (Exhibit A2–A7).21 We did this using geospatial
      data on climate hazards (including a probabilistic assessment of the severity of the hazard
      and the likelihood of occurrence of events of different severity), exposure, and resilience. For
      example, we evaluated the potential for physical asset destruction by assessing the likelihood
      of floods of different severity and multiplied that against capital stock exposed to the flooding
      and the share of capital stock that could be damaged at different flood severities. We then
      added these up across different flood events to arrive at an annual expected damage number
      (that is, a probability-weighted assessment of possible impact). Note that this analysis
      provides an estimate only of the direct impact of physical climate risk and not the knock-on
      effects. These country-level analyses were then added up, where possible, in order to derive
      global insights about the evolution and distribution of various forms of climate risk.

      A detailed discussion of the indicators used in the assessment is provided in Chapter 4 of
      the report. Here we primarily discuss the details of the hazard data used in the analysis,
      and climate models used in the analysis. We examined a subset of possible climate hazards,
      defining and measuring them as follows:

      Lethal heat waves are defined as three-day events during which average daily maximum
      “wet-bulb” temperature could exceed the survivability threshold for a healthy human being
      resting in the shade. (Wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature to which air can be
      cooled by the evaporation of water into the air at a constant pressure.) We took the average
      wet-bulb temperature of the hottest six-hour period across each rolling three-day period as
      the relevant threshold. This was calculated according to the methodology in Stull (2011).22 The
      threshold maximum temperature chosen for this analysis was 34 degrees Celsius wet-bulb
      because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35 degrees wet-bulb.
      At this temperature, a healthy human being, resting in the shade, can survive outdoors for four
      to five hours. Large cities with significant urban heat island effects could push 34 degrees
      Celsius wet-bulb heat waves over the 35-degree threshold. This could lead to widespread
      mortality in the absence of targeted adaptation.23 The lethal heatwave projections were
      derived from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, where each model was independently bias-



      21
           The indicators include: share of annual GDP at risk due to extreme heat and share of people at mortality risk due to lethal
           heat waves (measures of decrease in workability and livability), expected value of cereal production at risk of agricultural
           failure (measure of disruption of food systems), capital stock at risk of damage from floods, and share of a given decade
           spent in drought and land area experiencing biome shift (measures of destruction of natural capital).

      23
           A healthy human being can survive exposure to 35C wet-bulb temperatures for roughly 5 hours, assuming they are well
           hydrated and resting in the shade. For more details, please see Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber, "An adaptability

corrected using the ERA-Interim dataset.24 Specifically, the projected incidence of lethal
heatwaves between the 2021–40 period were counted across 20 GCMs drawn from the
CMIP5 ensemble and independently bias corrected. Because 20 single-year observations
across 20 models provides a sample size of only 400 years of data, the sample size was
bootstrapped out to 1,000 years. Once a robust statistical sample size was established, the
projected annual probability of a lethal heatwave was identified for each specific location
by treating each year as independent. To account for a bug in the arid land-atmosphere
feedbacks in the MIROC family of models, the analysis was performed both with and without
the MIROC models. The results were insensitive to their exclusion.25 We eventually excluded
all grid cells where the annual likelihood of lethal heatwaves was less than 1 percent. These
projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols
and urban heat island or cooling island effects. High levels of atmospheric aerosols provide a
cooling effect that masks the risk. Atmospheric aerosols, or air pollution reflect a proportion
of incoming sunlight and therefore artificially cool regions, reducing air temperatures.26

Today, the regions that are subject to non-zero risk of lethal heatwaves all have high
prevalence of atmospheric aerosols (see India case for further details). However, the
CMIP5 models have poor representation of observed atmospheric aerosols in those regions.
As a result, if the CMIP5 results showed a non-zero probability of lethal heat waves in certain
regions today, this was set to zero.

The other form of uncertainty relates to the urban heat island effect. A global analysis of
419 major cities showed that the average daytime temperature difference between urban
areas and their immediate surroundings is +1.5 ± 1.2°C, with some outliers up to 7 degrees
Celsuis warmer.27 Research has demonstrated that many cities in India exhibit a negative
urban heat island intensity in summer—that is, during the hot pre-monsoon season, they are
cooler than their surroundings. This cooling effect is due to both to atmospheric aerosols and
the relatively high vegetation cover in cities compared to their surroundings, which contain
largely barren lands that are converted to croplands only post-monsoon. While these findings
apply to much of the Indian subcontinent, the authors found that many cities in the north of the
country exhibit statistically significant positive urban heat island intensities. Because this area
of the country is also projected to be the first to exhibit heat waves close to the 35-degree
threshold and because a reduction in atmospheric aerosols could further reduce the artificial
cooling effect currently underway, these cities are at risk of having 34-degree heat waves
amplified to 35-degree heat waves.28

Annual share of effective outdoor working hours affected by extreme heat and humidity
in climate exposed-regions is calculated using the average percentage of a given 12-hour
workday lost in regions exposed to these hazards. Labor capacity is lost due to heat and
humidity through two mechanisms: the first, because workers must take breaks to avoid
heatstroke, and the second because the body will naturally limit physiological output
in hot conditions by fatiguing itself in a process known as “self-limiting.” Temperature
projections were likewise taken from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble mean projection,
again bias corrected using the ERA-Interim dataset. Conversion to lost working hours was
done following the methodology of Dunne et al. (2013), using combined ISO heat-exposure
standards corrected with empirical data from Foster et al. (2019).29 When deriving global GDP

      at risk, we applied lost working hours to GDP generated in sectors that we were confident
      are exposed to heat and humidity risk globally: agriculture, mining and quarrying, and
      construction. Lost working hours were applied one-to-one to sector GDP: that is, a projected
      X percent reduction in working hours is assumed to lead to an X percent reduction in sector
      GDP. These estimates are, as a result, likely an underestimate, as other sectors (particularly
      hospitality and tourism) are also exposed to heat. We considered a range based on the pace
      of sectoral transitions, ranging from keeping sector mix at today's level, to varying it going
      forward based on projections from IHS Markit Economics and Country Risk. To investigate
      the potential range of uncertainty around these findings, we explored the range of variability
      around the mean projection as captured by the ensemble model spread: we performed the
      same analysis using the 75th and 25th percentile ensemble projections. This was done to
      capture the potential impacts in an "average" year, compared with a "hotter than average" or
      "colder than average" year. Countries that include no change in share of effective outdoor
      working hours affected as a possible outcome within the range of model uncertainty by
      2030 were noted as likely not robust. All countries show robust trends by 2050.

      For our agricultural investigation, we used projections from the AgMIP ensemble. Changes
      in yield were quantified relative to the mean yield for the 1998–2017 period. Because
      projections from the AgMIP ensemble scale in skillfulness as a function of both physical
      spatial resolution and intensity of crop production, we were not able to perform a country-
      by-country analysis. (In other words, we were not able to obtain robust projections for small
      countries and large countries with marginal agricultural output.) Instead, we identified the
      largest grain breadbaskets in each region and quantified changes to output there. Agricultural
      projections were done using the mean projection from the full range of available GCMs, as well
      as the full range of non-potential-yield crop models. Nitrogen limitation and CO2 fertilization
      were kept “ON” for all projections. We did not account for reductions in nutritional content of
      crops. Therefore, these results may be underestimates, as future behavior of CO2 fertilization
      is not well constrained.

      Water stress and change in water supply is calculated using the increase or decrease in the
      average annual supply of renewable freshwater available in a given water basin. The amount of
      available renewable freshwater is a function of annual precipitation over that basin, as well as
      influx and outflux of water to and from that basin via riverine systems. Water supply data were
      taken from the World Resources Institute, which combines output from the CMIP5 ensemble
      with the GLDAS-2 NOAH v. 3.3 hydrological model. Data was taken from the World Resources
      Institute Water Risk Atlas (2018), which relies on six underlying CMIP5 models. Time periods
      of this raw dataset are the 20‑year periods centered on 2020, 2030, and 2040. The
      1998–2017 and 2041–60 data were linearly extrapolated from the 60‑year trend provided in
      the base dataset. For our global geospatial assessment across countries of water stress, we
      assumed water demand stayed constant at today's levels, to allow us to isolate and investigate
      the impact of climate change alone.

      Our flooding hazard measure starts first by assessing the depth and spatial extent of a
      riverine flood event (measured in volume) for the full probability exceedance curve (100%
      to 0% chance) in a given year over the 1960–1999 period in a given 900-by-900-meter
      grid cell globally. This database was taken from the World Resources Institute, and a full
      methodology on its development is available on their website. This was then overlaid with
      data on precipitation changes, to approximate future flood hazards. This approach therefore
      should be considered to be only an approximation of the evolution of flooding hazard, and it
      should be noted that a more robust analysis of flooding will require the use of granular flood
      models. While the probability of extreme precipitation events is increasing over most of the
      world (due to the ability of warmer air to hold more water vapor than colder air), this increase
      is not uniform. Change in extreme precipitation probability was taken from a 1,000-year
      bootstrap of the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, and then applied to the baseline flood data as
      a proxy for change in flood probability. When calculating capital stock at risk, the European
      Research Council’s global flood depth damage functions were applied to UNGAR15’s capital
      stock database. Existing flood protection for 1-in-50 to 1-in-100 year floods were assumed.

Further limitations of this analysis include the focus on riverine flooding only (versus tidal,
flash, or pluvial flooding, or flooding from storm surge), the ability to identify flood protections
globally in a robust way and therefore adjust for today’s level of adaptation, and the ability to
identify damage functions for capital stock that are specific to an individual site, such as a
given building or a factory, rather than rely on more general damage functions.

Our drought hazard is calculated using the percentage of a given decade spent in drought
conditions, where drought conditions are defined as a running three-month average where
the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index value is less than -2. Drought data were
taken from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble mean projection and corrected for changes in
biosphere behavior as a result of increases in atmospheric CO2.

Our measure of natural capital risk is defined as the percentage of land surface that changes
category under the Köppen climate classification system, which evaluates a particular area
based on average annual climate statistics, like precipitation and temperature. While not a
perfect analogue, ecosystem type correlates very closely with Köppen climate classification,
and therefore shifts are a good directional indicator of ecosystem stress or change. 30

     Atmospheric Sciences), April 2010, Volume 19, Number 2.

1. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen
   because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects
   could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of
   atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.
2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
Note: See the Technical appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

1. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C wet-bulb. This threshold was chosen
   because the commonly defined heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects
   could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of
   atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects.
2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
Note: See the Technical appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.

2. Water stress is measured as annual demand of water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water
   stays constant over time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions
   were excluded due to concerns about projection robustness.
3. Risk values are calculated based on “expected values”, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.
4. Calculated assuming constant exposure. Constant exposure means that we do not factor in any increases in population or assets, or shifts in the
   spatial mix of population and assets. This was done to allow us to isolate the impact of climate change alone. Color coding for each column based
   on the spread observed across countries within the indicator.
Note: See the Technical appendix for why we chose RCP 8.5. All projections based on RCP 8.5, CMIP 5 multi model ensemble. Heat data bias
   corrected. Following standard practice, we define current and future (2030, 2050) states as the average climatic behavior over multidecade
   periods. Climate state today is defined as average conditions between 1998 and 2017, in 2030 as average between 2021 and 2040, and in 2050
   as average between 2041 and 2060.
