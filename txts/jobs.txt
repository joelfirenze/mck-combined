Since its
About   MGI
          founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought
to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. As the
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aims
to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions. The Lauder
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania has ranked MGI the world’s number-
one private-sector think tank in its Think Tank Index.

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management,
employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic
industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces
affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have
covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets,
the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology
and innovation, and urbanization. Recent reports have assessed the
digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on employment, income
inequality, the productivity puzzle, the economic benefits of tackling gender
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and digital and
financial globalization.

MGI is led by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: Jacques Bughin,
Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika, who also serves as the chairman
of MGI. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, Sree Ramaswamy, and
Jaana Remes are MGI partners, and Jan Mischke and Jeongmin Seong are
MGI senior fellows.

Project teams are led by the MGI partners and a group of senior fellows,
and include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These
teams draw on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and
management experts. Advice and input to MGI research are provided by
the MGI Council, members of which are also involved in MGI’s research.
MGI council members are drawn from around the world and from various
sectors and include Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, Richard Dobbs,
Tarek Elmasry, Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Eric Labaye, Acha Leke,
Scott Nyquist, Gary Pinkus, Sven Smit, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen.
In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, act as research
advisers to MGI research.

The partners of McKinsey fund MGI’s research; it is not commissioned by any
business, government, or other institution. For further information about MGI

PREFACE

Automation is not a new phenomenon, and fears about its transformation of the workplace
and effects on employment date back centuries, even before the Industrial Revolution in
the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1960s, US President Lyndon Johnson empaneled a
“National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress.” Among its
conclusions was “the basic fact that technology destroys jobs, but not work.”* Fast forward
and rapid recent advances in automation technologies, including artificial intelligence,
autonomous systems, and robotics are now raising the fears anew—and with new urgency.
In our January 2017 report on automation, A future that works: Automation, employment,
and productivity, we analyzed the automation potential of the global economy, the timelines
over which the phenomenon could play out, and the powerful productivity boost that
automation adoption could deliver.

This report goes a step further by examining both the potential labor market disruptions
from automation and some potential sources of new labor demand that will create jobs.
We develop scenarios that seek to address some of the questions most often raised in the
public debate. Will there be enough work in the future to maintain full employment, and if so
what will that work be? Which occupations will thrive, and which ones will wither? What are
the potential implications for skills and wages as machines perform some or the tasks that
humans now do?

The report is part of the McKinsey Global Institute’s research program on the future of work,
and is by no means the final word on this topic. The technology continues to evolve, as will
our collective understanding of the economic implications. Indeed, we highlight some of the
limitations of our analysis and scenarios, and areas for further research. The report builds on
our previous research on labor markets, incomes, skills, and the expanding range of models
of work, including the gig economy, as well as the potential impacts on the global economy
of digitization, automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

The research was led by James Manyika, chairman and director of the McKinsey Global
Institute and McKinsey senior partner based in San Francisco; Susan Lund, an MGI partner
based in Washington, DC; Michael Chui, an MGI partner in San Francisco; Jacques Bughin,
MGI director and McKinsey senior partner based in Brussels; and Jonathan Woetzel,
MGI director and McKinsey senior partner in Shanghai. Parul Batra, Ryan Ko, and
Saurabh Sanghvi headed the research team at different times over the course of the project.
The team comprised Julian Albert, Gurneet Singh Dandona, Nicholas Fletcher, Darien Lee,
Nik Nayar, Sonia Vora, and Rachel Wong.

We are deeply grateful to our academic advisers, who challenged our thinking and provided
valuable feedback and guidance throughout the research. We thank Richard N. Cooper,
Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics at Harvard University; Sir
Christopher Pissarides, Nobel laureate and Regius Professor of Economics at the London

    We use the term “jobs” as shorthand for full-time equivalent workers (FTEs), and apply it to both work displaced by automation and to new work
    created by future labor demand. In reality, the number of people working is larger than the number of FTEs, as some people work part-time. Our
    analysis of FTEs covers both employees within firms as well as independent contractors and freelancers.

                                    In our prior report on automation, we found that about half the activities people are paid to
                                    do globally could theoretically be automated using currently demonstrated technologies.3
                                    Very few occupations—less than 5 percent—consist entirely of activities that can be
                                    fully automated. However, in about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the
                                    constituent activities could be automated, implying substantial workplace transformations
                                    and changes for all workers. All this is based on our assessments of current technological
                                    capability—an ever evolving frontier (Exhibit E1).

                                    While technical feasibility of automation is important, it is not the only factor that will influence
                                    the pace and extent of automation adoption. Other factors include the cost of developing
                                    and deploying automation solutions for specific uses in the workplace, the labor market

                                    into account these factors, our new research estimates that between almost zero and
                                    30 percent of the hours worked globally could be automated by 2030, depending on the

McKinsey Global Institute           Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation                                           5


                          The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector.
                          Activities most susceptible to automation include physical ones in predictable environments,
                          such as operating machinery and preparing fast food. Collecting and processing data
                          are two other categories of activity that can increasingly be done better and faster with
                          machines. This could displace large amounts of labor, for instance in mortgage origination,
                          paralegal work, accounting, and back-office transaction processing. It is important to note,
                          however, that even when some tasks are automated, employment in those occupations
                          may not decline, but rather workers may perform new tasks. In addition, employment in
                          occupations may also grow, if the overall demand for that occupation grows enough to
                          overwhelm the rates of automation.

                          Automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people, applying
                          expertise, and those involving social interactions, where machines are unable to match
                          human performance for now. Jobs in unpredictable environments—occupations such as
                          gardeners, plumbers, or providers of child- and elder-care—will also generally see less
                          automation by 2030, because they are difficult to automate technically and often command
                          relatively lower wages, which makes automation a less attractive business proposition.

                          RISING INCOMES, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY, AND
                          OTHER CATALYSTS COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS
Up to                     While automation’s displacement of labor has been visible for many years, it is more difficult


130M
                          to envision all the new jobs that will be created. Many of these new jobs are created indirectly
                          and spread across different sectors and geographies.

new jobs in health        In this report, we model some potential sources of new labor demand that may spur job
care from aging           creation to 2030, even net of automation. We consider two scenarios, a “trendline” scenario
and rising incomes        based on current spending and investment trends observed across countries, and a “step-
by 2030                   up” scenario that assumes additional investments in some areas. We calculate jobs (full-time
                          equivalents) that could be created both directly and indirectly for more than 800 existing
                          occupations. We do not consider the dynamic interactions between trends or across the
                          economy (Exhibit E4). The results are not precise forecasts of future job growth, but rather
                          are suggestive of where jobs of the future may be.

                          For three trends, we model only a trendline scenario. They are:

                           Rising incomes and consumption, especially in emerging economies. Previous
                             MGI research has estimated that 1 billion more people will enter the consuming class by
                             2025.4 Using external macroeconomic forecasts, we estimate that global consumption
                             could grow by $23 trillion between 2015 and 2030, and most of this will come from the
                             expanding consuming classes in emerging economies. As incomes rise, consumers
                             spend more on all categories. But their spending patterns also shift, creating more jobs
                             in areas such as consumer durables, leisure activities, financial and telecommunication
                             services, housing, health care, and education. The effects of these new consumers will
                             be felt not just in the countries where the income is generated, but also in economies that
                             export to those countries.5 Globally, we estimate that 300 million to 365 million new jobs
                             could be created from the impact of rising incomes.

                           Aging populations. By 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people aged
                             65 years and above than there were in 2014. As people age, their spending patterns

                          4
                              We define consuming classes or consumers as individuals with an annual income of more than $3,600, or $10
                              per day, at purchasing power parity, using constant 2005 PPP dollars. Urban world: Cities and the rise of the
                              consuming class, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2012.
                          5
                              We assume that current patterns of global trade continue, at the same level relative to GDP as today. As a
                              result, advanced economies also benefit from rising incomes in developing countries. The United States,
                              for example, could gain up to 3 percent of net new jobs from rising incomes by 2030 from net exports. In
                              Germany’s case, that figure could be more than 40 percent.

                                        shift, with a pronounced increase in spending on health care and other personal
                                        services. This will create significant demand for a range of occupations, including
                                        doctors, nurses, and health technicians, but also home health aides, personal care aides
                                        and nursing assistants in many countries, even as it reduces demand for pediatricians
                                        and primary-school teachers. Globally, we estimate heath care and related jobs from
                                        aging and rising incomes could grow by 80 million to 130 million by 2030.6



50M
                                    Development and deployment of technology. Jobs related to developing and
                                      deploying new technologies may also grow. These jobs include computer scientists,
                                      engineers, and IT administrators. Overall spending on technology could increase by
new technology
                                      more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. About half would be on information
jobs by 2030
                                      technology services, both in-house IT workers within companies and external or
                                      outsourced tech consulting jobs. The number of people employed in these occupations
                                      is small compared to those in health care or construction, but they are high-wage
                                      occupations. By 2030, we estimate this trend could create 20 to 50 million jobs globally.

                           For three other trends, we model both a trendline scenario and a step-up scenario; the latter
                           is based on explicit choices that could be made by governments, business leaders, and
                           individuals to create additional jobs.

                            Investment in infrastructure and buildings. Infrastructure and buildings are two
                              areas of historic underspending that may create significant additional labor demand
                              if action is taken to bridge infrastructure gaps and overcome housing shortages. MGI
                              has estimated that the world needs to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP annually, or an
                              average of $3.3 trillion per year to fill infrastructure gaps, compared with $2.5 trillion
                              currently.7 This includes both developing countries that are urbanizing and industrializing,
                              and advanced economies that have underinvested in maintaining their infrastructure
                              and buildings. Rising incomes also create demand for more and higher quality buildings.
                              Both factors could create new demand, mainly in the construction sector, for up to
                              80 million jobs in the trendline scenario and, in some cases, potentially up to 200 million
                              globally in the step-up scenario.8 These jobs include architects, engineers, carpenters
                              and other skilled tradespeople, as well as construction workers, machinery operators
                              and other jobs with lower skill requirements.

                            Investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation.
                              Investments in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, energy efficiency
                              technologies, and adaptation and mitigation of climate change may create new demand
                              for workers in a range of occupations, including in manufacturing, construction, and
                              installation. In our trendline scenario, we model future job growth based on already-
                              announced policy intentions for energy efficiency and the required investment to meet
                              these goals.9 For a step-up scenario, we use more ambitious targets that countries
                              will need to get closer to meeting commitments to the Paris climate accord.10 These
                              investments could create up to ten million new jobs in the trendline scenario, and up to
                              ten million additional jobs globally in the step-up scenario.



20M
                            “Marketization” of previously unpaid domestic work. The last trend we consider
                              is the potential to pay for services that substitute for currently unpaid and primarily
                              domestic work—including cooking, childcare, and cleaning. This so-called marketization
potential new jobs
                              of previously unpaid work is already prevalent in advanced economies, and rising female
from energy
                              labor force participation worldwide could accelerate the trend. About 75 percent of the
investments in our
                              world’s total unpaid care is undertaken by women and amounts to as much as $10 trillion
step-up scenario              of output per year, roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.11 Individual decisions
                              within the household to use paid services or government investment to provide universal
                              childcare and pre-school could fuel this development. We consider this in the step-up
                              scenario only, as its magnitude and timing is unclear. But we estimate that this shift could
                              marketize 50 million to 90 million unpaid jobs globally, mainly in occupations such as
                              childcare, early childhood education, cleaning, cooking, and gardening.

                                In the step-up scenario, we assume higher levels of run-rate infrastructure investment after countries have
                                closed their respective infrastructure gap. We also assume that, at minimum, countries reach levels of
                                commercial and residential real estate investment comparable to those in the United States.

                            UP TO 375 MILLION PEOPLE MAY NEED TO SWITCH OCCUPATIONAL
                            CATEGORIES, WITH THE HIGHEST SHARE IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES
                            When we look at the net changes in job growth and decline from the trends described
                            above compared with the work that can be automated, a mosaic of shifts in occupations
                            and job categories emerges (Exhibit E5).

                            Across all countries, the categories with the highest percentage job growth net of
                            automation include health-care providers; professionals such as engineers, scientists,
                            accountants, and analysts; IT professionals and other technology specialists; managers and
                            executives, whose work cannot easily be replaced by machines; educators, especially in
                            emerging economies with young populations; and “creatives,” a small but growing category
                            of artists, performers, and entertainers who will be in demand as rising incomes create
                            more demand for leisure and recreation. Builders and related professions will also grow,
                            particularly in the step-up scenario that involves higher investment in infrastructure and
                            buildings. Manual and service jobs in unpredictable environments will also grow, such as
                            home health aides and gardeners.

                            Advanced economies may also see employment declines in occupations that are most
                            susceptible to automation. These include office support occupations, such as record
                            clerks, office assistants, and finance and accounting; some customer interaction jobs,
                            such as hotel and travel workers, cashiers, and food service workers; and a wide range of
                            jobs carried out in predictable settings, such as assembly line workers, dishwashers, food
                            preparation workers, drivers, and agricultural and other equipment operators. Helping
                            individuals transition from the declining occupations to growing ones will be a large-
                            scale challenge.

                            The coming workforce transitions among occupations could be very large
                            The changes in net occupational growth or decline imply that a very large number of people
                            may need to shift occupational categories and learn new skills in the years ahead. The shift
                            could be on a scale not seen since the transition of the labor force out of agriculture in the
                            early 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently in China. But unlike those
                            earlier transitions, in which young people left farms and moved to cities for industrial jobs,
                            the challenge, especially in advanced economies, will be to retrain midcareer workers.
                            There are few precedents in which societies have successfully retrained such large numbers
                            of people. Frictions in the labor markets—including cultural norms regarding gender
                            stereotypes in work and geographic mismatches between workers and jobs—could also
                            impede the transition.12

Up to                               We estimate that between 400 million and 800 million individuals could be displaced by


1/3
                                    automation and need to find new jobs by 2030 around the world, based on our midpoint
                                    and earliest (that is, the most rapid) automation adoption scenarios. We think demand for
                                    jobs will be there, based on our scenarios of future labor demand and the net impact of
of workforce in the
                                    automation, as described in the next section. However people will need to find their way into
United States and                   these jobs. Of the total displaced, 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occupational
Germany may                         categories and learn new skills, under our midpoint and earliest automation adoption
need to find work                   scenarios (Exhibit E6).13 Under the latest adoption scenario (that is, the slowest), this number
in new occupations                  would be far lower, below 10 million. Given the minimal impact on the workforce of this
                                    edge-case scenario, we have not highlighted it in the exhibits in this report. In absolute
                                    terms, China faces the largest number of workers needing to switch occupations—up to
                                    100 million if automation is adopted rapidly, or 12 percent of the 2030 workforce—although
                                    this figure is relatively small compared with the huge shift in China out of agriculture in the
                                    past 25 years. For advanced economies, the share of the workforce that may need to learn
                                    new skills and find work in new occupations is much higher: up to one-third of the 2030
                                    workforce in the United States and Germany, and nearly half in Japan.

                     WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE?
                     Today there is growing concern about whether there will be enough jobs for workers given
                     potential automation. History would suggest that such fears may be unfounded: over time,
                     labor markets adjust to changes in demand for workers from technological disruptions,
                     although at times with depressed real wages. We address this question about the future
                     of work through two different sets of analyses: one based on modeling of a limited number
                     of catalysts of new labor demand and automation described above, and one using a
                     macroeconomic model of the economy that incorporates the dynamic interactions
                     among variables. We also note that if history is any guide, we could expect 8 to 9 percent
                     of 2030 labor demand will be in new types of occupations that have not existed before.14
                     Both analyses lead us to conclude that, with sufficient economic growth, innovation, and
                     investment, there can be enough new job creation to offset the impact of automation,
                     although in some advanced economies additional investments will be needed as per our
                     step-up scenario to reduce the risk of job shortages. But a larger challenge will be ensuring
                     that workers have the skills and support needed to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail
                     to manage this transition could see rising unemployment and depressed wages.

                     Future jobs lost and jobs gained vary by country, with the largest disruptions
                     expected in advanced economies
                     The magnitude of future job creation from the trends described above and the impact of
                     automation on the workforce vary significantly by country, depending on four factors:

                      Wage levels. Higher wages make the business case for automation adoption stronger.
                        However, low-wage countries may be affected as well, if companies adopt automation
                        to boost quality, achieve tighter production control, move production closer to end
                        consumers in high-wage countries, or other benefits beyond reducing labor costs. Some
                        economists worry about “premature deindustrialization” in developing countries due
                        to automation.15

                      Demand growth. Economic growth is essential for job creation; economies that are
                        stagnant or growing slowly create few if any net new jobs. Countries with stronger
                        economic and productivity growth and innovation will therefore be expected to
                        experience more new labor demand, although the amount and nature of job creation will
                        vary depending on the sectors that drive growth.

                      Demographics. Demographics affect both labor demand and labor supply. Countries
                        with a rapidly-growing workforce, such as India, may enjoy a “demographic dividend”
                        that boosts GDP growth—if young people are employed. Countries with a shrinking
                        workforce, such as Japan, can expect lower future GDP growth, derived only from
                        productivity growth. However, countries with a declining workforce need automation to
                        offset their shrinking labor supply, while countries with growing workforces have greater
                        job creation challenges.

                      Mix of economic sectors and occupations. The automation potential for countries
                        reflects the mix of economic sectors and the mix of jobs within each sector. Japan, for
                        example, has a higher technical automation potential than the United States because
                        the weight of sectors that are highly automatable, such as manufacturing, is higher. And
                        within Japanese manufacturing, a larger proportion of jobs involve activities that can be
                        more easily automated, such as production, than in the United States.

                            These factors combine to create different outlooks for the future of work in each country
                            (Exhibit E7). For instance, Japan is rich but its economy is projected to grow slowly to 2030.
                            It faces the combination of slower job creation coming from economic expansion and a
                            large share of work that can be automated as a result of high wages and the structure of its
                            economy. However, Japan will also see its workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people.
                            In the step-up scenario, and considering the jobs in new occupations we cannot envision
                            today, Japan’s net change in jobs could be roughly in balance.

                            Like Japan, the United States and Germany could also face significant workforce
                            displacement from automation by 2030, but their projected future growth—and hence
                            new job creation—is higher. The United States has a growing workforce and, in the step-
                            up scenario, with innovations leading to new types of occupations and work, Germany’s
                            workforce will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor
                            demand to employ all workers.

                            At the other extreme is India: a fast-growing developing country with relatively modest
                            potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflecting low wage rates. Our analysis finds
                            that most occupational categories are projected to grow in India, reflecting its potential for
Growth in India’s
                            strong economic expansion. However, India’s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million
labor force by 2030
                            people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrants in formal sector jobs
                            will require job creation on a much larger scale than in the past. Automation will make this
                            challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth.”16 However, our analysis suggests
                            that India can create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ new entrants, if it
                            undertakes the investments in our step-up scenario.

                            China and Mexico have higher wages than India, and so are likely to see more automation.
                            China is still projected to have robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce;
                            like Germany, China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Mexico’s projected rate of
                            future economic expansion is more modest, and its workforce will grow by 15 million by
                            2030. Like the United States and Japan, our results suggest that Mexico could benefit from
                            the job creation in the step-up scenario plus innovation in new occupations and activities to
                            make full use of its workforce.

                            If displaced workers are not reemployed quickly, countries will face rising
                            unemployment and depressed wages
                            To model the impact of automation on overall employment and wages, we use a general
                            equilibrium model of the economies of our six focus countries that takes into account the
                            economic impacts of automation and dynamic interactions.17 The model is not intended to
                            forecast the future, but rather is a tool to explore the implications of different scenarios.

                            Automation has at least three distinct economic impacts. Most attention has been devoted
                            to the potential displacement of labor. But automation also may raise labor productivity:
                            firms only adopt automation when doing so enables them to produce more or higher-quality
                            output with the same or fewer inputs (including material, energy, and labor inputs). The third
                            impact is that automation adoption raises investment in the economy, lifting short-term GDP
                            growth. We model all three effects.18 We also create different scenarios for how quickly
                            displaced workers find new employment, based on historical data.

                            The results reveal that across different rates of re-employment, our six countries could
                            expect to be at or very near full employment by 2030. Consistent with the historical
                            experience, labor markets adjust to technological shocks. However, the model also
                            illustrates the importance of reemploying displaced workers quickly. If displaced workers
                            are able to be reemployed within one year, our model shows automation lifting the overall
                            economy: full employment is maintained in both the short and long-term, wages grow
                            faster than in the baseline model, and productivity is higher. However, in scenarios in which
                            some displaced workers take years to find new work, unemployment rises in the short- to
                            medium-term. The labor market adjusts over time and unemployment falls—but with slower
                            average wage growth. In these scenarios, average wages end up lower in 2030 than in
                            the baseline model, which could dampen aggregate demand and long-term growth. The
                            pace of reemployment will be influenced by the effectiveness of retraining, the capacity of
                            companies to innovate and, in some sectors, the elasticity of demand.

                            WORKERS WILL REQUIRE DIFFERENT SKILLS, AND WAGE POLARIZATION IN
                            ADVANCED COUNTRIES COULD CONTINUE
                            In all six of our focus countries, we find that in general, the current educational requirements
                            of the occupations that may grow are higher than those for the jobs displaced by
                            automation. In advanced economies, occupations that currently require only a secondary
                            education or less see a net decline from automation, while those occupations requiring
                            college degrees and higher grow. In India and other emerging economies, we find higher
                            labor demand for all education levels, with the largest number of new jobs in occupations
                            requiring a secondary education but the fastest rate of job growth will be for occupations
                            currently requiring a college or advanced degree (Exhibit E8). For all countries, increasing
                            investments in education and workforce training will be a priority.

                            Moreover, we find that workers of the future will spend more time on activities that machines
                            are less capable of, such as managing people, applying expertise, and communicating
                            with others. They will spend less time on predictable physical activities, and on collecting
                            and processing data, where machines already exceed human performance. The skills and
                            capabilities required will also shift, requiring more social and emotional skills, and more
                            advanced cognitive capabilities, such as logical reasoning and creativity.

                                 We used McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model, a supply-side general equilibrium macroeconomic
                                 model that covers more than 100 countries with data from 1960 through 2015.

                                 We obtain data for labor displacement and required firm investment from MGI’s automation model, at the
                                 midpoint adoption scenario. We make a conservative assumption on the productivity impact of automation,
                                 that firms produce the same value of output as prior to automation but with fewer workers. See technical

                            Wage polarization could be exacerbated in advanced economies but developing
                            countries will see a growing middle class
                            Wages may stagnate or fall in declining occupations. Although we do not model shifts in
                            relative wages across occupations, the basic economics of labor supply and demand
                            suggests that this should be the case for occupations in which labor demand declines.
                            Since 1980, most advanced economies have seen an overall declining share of national
                            income being captured by labor (compared with capital). Recent academic work suggests
                            that technological change is one reason for this decline.19

                            Our analysis, looking at changes in employment by occupation at today’s relative wage
                            levels, shows that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economies
                            will be in occupations currently at the high end of the wage distribution. Some occupations
                            that are currently low-wage, such as nursing assistants and teaching assistants, will
                            also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupations will have the largest
                            employment declines. These results suggest that income polarization could continue.
                            Policy choices we identified in our step-up scenario, such as increasing investments in
                            infrastructure, buildings, and energy transitions could help create additional demand for
                            middle-wage jobs such as construction workers in advanced economies.

                            The wage trend picture is quite different in emerging economies such as China and India,
                            where our scenarios show that middle-wage jobs such as retail salespeople and teachers
                            will grow quickly as these economies develop. This implies that their consuming class will
                            continue to grow in the decades ahead. However, our analysis comes with several important
                            caveats (see Box E2, “What could overstate or understate the impact scenarios assessed in
                            this research—and what we have not considered”).

                            BUSINESSES AND POLICYMAKERS WILL NEED TO ACT TO KEEP PEOPLE
                            WORKING AS AUTOMATION IS ADOPTED
                            The benefits of AI and automation to users and businesses, and the economic growth that
                            could come via their productivity contributions, are compelling. They will not only contribute
                            to dynamic economies that create jobs, but also help create the economic surpluses that
                            will enable societies to address the workforce transitions that will likely happen regardless.
                            Faced with the scale of worker transitions we have described, one reaction could be to try
                            to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve the status quo. While this
                            may limit the workforce transitions, it would affect the contributions that these technologies
                            make to business dynamism and economic growth, via the contribution to productivity
                            growth, and which in turn leads to jobs growth and prosperity. We should embrace these
                            technologies but also address the workforce transitions and challenges they bring. In many
                            countries, this may require an initiative on the scale of the Marshall Plan involving sustained
                            investment, new training models, programs to ease worker transitions, income support, and

                            Achieving the benefits of deploying automation, such as productivity growth, while
                            addressing its challenges, is not impossible. During the transition out of agriculture, for
                            example, the United States made a major investment in expanding secondary education,
                            and for the first time required all students to attend. Called the High School Movement,
                            this raised the rate of high school enrolment of 14- to 17-year-olds from 18 percent in 1910

                                    to 73 percent in 1940, making the US workforce among the best-educated and most
                                    productive in the world, and enabling the growth of a vibrant manufacturing sector.20

                                    Policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers all have constructive and important
                                    roles to play in smoothing workforce transitions ahead. History shows that societies across
                                    the globe, when faced with monumental challenges, often rise to the occasion for the well-
                                    being of their citizens. Yet over the last few decades, investments and policies to support
                                    the workforce have eroded. Public spending on labor force training and support has fallen in
                                    most OECD countries, and corporate spending on training has declined in the United States
                                    (Exhibit E9). Educational models have not fundamentally changed in 100 years; we still
                                    use systems designed for an industrial society to prepare students for a rapidly-changing
                                    knowledge economy. It is now critical to reverse these trends, with governments making
                                    workforce transitions and job creation a more urgent priority.

                            Today, while policy choices will vary by country, all societies will need to address four key
                            areas to smooth the looming workforce transitions:

                             Maintaining robust economic growth to support job creation. Sustaining robust
                               aggregate demand growth is critical to support new job creation, as is support for
                               new business formation. Fiscal and monetary policies that ensure sufficient aggregate
                               demand, as well as support for business investment and innovation, will be essential.
                               Targeted initiatives in certain sectors could also help, including by increasing investment
                               in infrastructure and energy transitions, as well as policies to enable a shift of unpaid
                               household work such as childcare to the market, as discussed in our step-up scenario.

                             Scaling and reimagining job retraining and workforce skills development. Providing
                               job retraining and enabling individuals to learn marketable new skills throughout their
                               lifetimes will be a critical challenge—and for some countries, the central challenge.
                               Midcareer retraining will become ever more important as the skill mix needed for a
                               successful career changes. A range of initiatives in countries from Sweden to Singapore
                               may point the way to new approaches to improving skills or teaching new ones, including
                               to older workers. Governments can play an important role here, as the US government
                               did in previous eras with the GI Bill, which enabled just under eight million veterans
                               returning from war to go to college or be retrained.21 Programs that can more quickly
                               retool the labor force by focusing on re-training and credentialing at the level of skills
                               in demand rather than multi-year degrees could be important. Business can take a
                               lead in some areas, including with on-the-job training and providing opportunities to
                               workers to upgrade their skills, both through in-house training and partnerships with
                               education providers.

                             Improving business and labor market dynamism including mobility. Greater fluidity
                               will be needed in the labor market to manage the difficult transitions we anticipate. This
                               includes restoring now-waning geographic mobility in advanced economies including
                               the United States. Digital talent platforms and the rise of the “gig” economy can foster
                               fluidity, by matching workers and companies seeking their skills, and by providing a
                               plethora of new work opportunities for those open to taking them.22 Policy makers
                               in countries with relatively inflexible labor markets can learn from others that have
                               deregulated, such as Germany, which transformed its federal unemployment agency into
                               a powerful job-matching entity. Governments may also update labor market regulations
                               to ensure that gig economy jobs are not subject to discrimination, and that remaining
                               uncertainties about worker benefits are resolved.

                             Providing income and transition support to workers. Income support and other
                               forms of transition assistance to help displaced workers find gainful employment will
                               be essential. Beyond retraining, a range of policies can help, including unemployment
                               insurance, public assistance in finding work, and portable benefits that follow workers
                               between jobs. We know from history and from our analysis that wages for many
                               occupations can be depressed for some time during workforce transitions. More
                               permanent policies to supplement work incomes might be needed to support aggregate
                               demand and ensure societal fairness. Possible solutions to supplement incomes, such
                               as more comprehensive minimum wage policies, universal basic income, or wage gains
                               tied to productivity, are all being explored.

                     Business leaders have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies,
                     enabling performance benefits such as quality and speed, as well as greater efficiency
                     and productive use of all factors of production. Businesses will be on the front lines of the
                     workplace as it changes. That will require them to both retool their business processes
                     and re-evaluate their talent strategies and workforce needs, carefully considering which
                     individuals are needed, which can be redeployed to other jobs, and where new talent may
                     be needed. Many companies are finding it is in their self-interest—as well as important for
                     societal responsibility—to train and prepare workers for a new world of work.

                     Individuals, too, will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future of work. Acquiring new
                     skills that are in demand and resetting intuition about the world of work will be critical for
                     their own well-being. There will be demand for human labor, but workers everywhere will
                     need to rethink traditional notions of where they work, how they work, and what talents and
                     capabilities they bring to that work. Ultimately, we will all need creative visions for how our
                     lives are organized and valued in the future, in a world where the role and meaning of work
                     start to shift.

                                                                   •••

                     Automation represents both hope and challenge. The global economy needs the boost to
                     productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when aging populations are
                     acting as a drag on GDP growth. Machines can take on work that is routine, dangerous, or
                     dirty, and may allow us all to use our intrinsically human talents more fully. But to capture
                     these benefits, societies will need to prepare for complex workforce transitions ahead. For
                     policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers the world over, the task at hand
                     is to prepare for a more automated future by emphasizing new skills, scaling up training,
                     especially for midcareer workers, and ensuring robust economic growth.

1. JOBS LOST, JOBS CHANGED:
IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON WORK
We live in an age when machines answer customer inquiries, help doctors understand
X-rays, lip-read better than human professionals, and sort trash into compost and
recyclables—an age, too, when the public debate about automation and its impact on the
workplace raises anxious questions. First is the existential one about the future of work
itself. Given rapid advances in technologies including robotics and artificial intelligence, will
there be enough work to ensure full employment? Second is the question about what those
jobs will be, and which skills will be needed for them. The third is what all this could mean
for wages.

We seek to address these questions in this report through, first, an analysis of automation
potential and scenarios about the extent of adoption of current work activities by 2030
and, second, an analysis of potential future labor demand. We looked at 46 countries,
representing almost 90 percent of global GDP. To illustrate the potential impact at a country
level, we use six as exemplars of countries that vary by sector and occupation mix, GDP per
capita growth, wage rates, and demographics: China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and
the United States.23

In this chapter, we focus on automation’s potential to transform the workplace. Building
on our previous automation work, we create a range for the number of hours that could be
displaced by automation by 2030, and seek to identify the work activities, occupations, and
sectors that are most—and least—susceptible to being automated (see Box 1, “Automation’s
rapid advances and its limitations—for now”).24

Among the findings of our new research are that as much as 30 percent of the hours
worked globally could be automated by 2030, depending on the speed of adoption, with
15 percent of current work activities being automated in our midpoint scenario. The speed
of adoption depends on factors including technical feasibility, the pace of technology
development, costs, and social and regulatory acceptance. These results differ significantly
by country, reflecting the mix of activities currently performed by workers and prevailing
wage rates, ranging from 9 percent in India to 26 percent in Japan in the midpoint adoption
rate scenario.

automated by                   for that, additional productivity-boosting measures will be needed, including reworking
adapting currently             business processes or developing new products and services. Nonetheless, the
demonstrated                   productivity growth enabled by automation can ensure continued prosperity in aging
technologies                   nations and provide an additional boost to fast-growing ones.25

                             For companies, the deployment of automation can deliver benefits in the form of labor
                               cost savings, but also in myriad other performance-enhancing ways. It can enable firms
                               to get closer to customers and predict maintenance needs, sharply reducing the cost of
                               operations in some activities and extending the life of existing capital assets. Automation
                               can also increase scale and speed. Nissan, for example, has halved the time it takes
                               to move from final product design to production thanks to an automated system, while
                               BMW has reduced machine downtime by 30 to 40 percent—effectively generating fresh
                               economies of scale with minimal investment—through AI-enabled condition-based
                               maintenance.26 Exhibit 1 compares the estimated potential performance and labor cost
                               reduction benefits from automation for a number of key processes within some sectors.
                               These findings are based on estimates of potential in case studies informed by our work
                               with industry.

                             Overall, our analysis suggested that roughly 50 percent of the time spent on activities

                               words, the technical capabilities already exist, although an integrated solution to
                               automate each particular activity might not yet have been developed nor deployed. We
                               estimated the potential for technology to automate the more than 2,000 work activities
                               in about 800 occupations across the economy, by adapting currently demonstrated
                               technologies. (We examined work activities individually rather than whole occupations,
                               since occupations consist of a range of activities with different potential for automation).
                               Certain categories of activity are more susceptible to automation than others.27 While
                               less than 5 percent of occupations can be fully automated, about 60 percent have
                               at least 30 percent of activities that can technically be automated (see illustration,
                               “Automation: A global force that will transform economies and the workforce”).

                             Our automation analysis found significant variation among sectors of the economy,
                               and among the occupations within those sectors. For example, almost one-fifth of
                               the time spent in US workplaces involves predictable physical activity and is prevalent
                               in such sectors as manufacturing and retail trade. Accordingly, these sectors have a
                               relatively high technical potential for automation by adapting currently demonstrated
                               technologies. Even within sectors, there is considerable variation. In manufacturing, for

                                 Even at historical rates of productivity growth, economic growth could be nearly halved as a result of this aging

                                     environments such as factory welders have a technical automation potential above
                                     90 percent, whereas for customer service representatives that potential is less than
                                     30 percent.

                                    solutions for the workplace—that is actually developing integrated solutions for
                                    specific use cases; labor market dynamics including the supply, demand, and cost of
                                    human labor; the net economic benefits of automation, which include performance
                                    benefits beyond labor substitution such as higher throughput, raised productivity, and
                                    heightened safety; and regulatory and social acceptance. Labor market dynamics in
                                    particular plays an important role in the national variations around automation adoption,
                                    since wage rates vary widely by country, even for similar occupations. The relative cost
                                    of automation compared with the cost of labor will affect adoption: if qualified workers
                                    are in abundant supply and significantly less expensive than automation, this could be
                                    a decisive argument against automation in that situation. Consequently, in the period
                                    to 2030, we expect advanced economies, with wage levels that are relatively higher, to
                                    adopt automation earlier than many emerging economies, especially if adoption requires
                                    expensive hardware solutions. That said, our automation modeling does consider the
                                    continuing improvement in automation technologies’ capabilities over time, as well as
                                    decreasing costs.

scenario                         social factors affecting the pace and extent of automation, described above, the proportion
                                 of work actually displaced by 2030 will likely be lower. We estimate that up to 30 percent
                                 of current work activities could be displaced by 2030, with a midpoint of 15 percent, or the
                                 hours of about 400 million full-time equivalents. Indeed, the range of outcomes is particularly
                                 wide in 2030 in our model; in the event of late automation adoption, the percentage of
                                 work activities displaced by 2030 would be close to zero. Among countries, too, especially
                                 between advanced economies and emerging ones, the range is wide. Exhibit 2 highlights
                                 both how we arrived at our range of automation scenarios, and the modeling we used
                                 for estimating scenarios for future labor demand, which we describe in detail in the
                                 following chapter.

                                   For the six countries we use as exemplars in this report, the hours that could be automated
                                   by 2030 in the midpoint adoption case range from 26 percent of the hours worked in
                                   Japan to 9 percent in India (Exhibit 3). Developed countries Germany (24 percent) and the
                                   United States (23 percent) are not far behind Japan, followed by China (16 percent) and
                                   Mexico (13 percent). In general, wage rates are the biggest determinant of the difference
                                   in automation scenarios among countries; higher wage rates make automation more
                                   economically attractive. In addition, the mix of activities, which is related to the mix of sectors
                                   and occupations, also affects the modeled rate of automation. Among the main differences
                                   between emerging and advanced economies is the importance of agriculture in the former.
                                   In Germany and Japan, manufacturing also has high automation potential. That said,
                                   emerging economies could leverage automation technologies aggressively in an effort to
                                   leapfrog their economic development. China, for example, has fewer robots per worker than
                                   the global average, but received nearly one-third of all robot shipments in 2016.28

                                   At the other extreme of the scenarios we modeled, in our latest adoption scenario, less than
                                   0.5 percent of work hours globally will be automated by 2030, and advanced economies will
                                   account for the large majority of them.

                                    Automation will displace workers with different educational attainment across
                                    a wide range of occupations
                                    Just as there is a wide variation in automation’s impact on countries and sectors, so, too, its
                                    effect on specific occupations will vary. Those professions highly dependent on the work
                                    activities we identified as most susceptible to automation—physical work in a predictable
                                    environment, or data collection and processing—are likely to be the most affected,
                                    especially if automation adoption occurs earlier, which we anticipate to be the case in
                                    countries with high wages such as Japan, Germany, and other advanced economies. By
                                    comparison, occupations that require application of expertise, interaction with stakeholders,
                                    management and coaching of others, or a high degree of social and emotional response will
                                    be less susceptible to automation in the period to 2030.

                                    Occupations incorporating significant amounts of physical work in predictable environments
                                    including production workers and building and grounds cleaners, as well as office support
                                    (such as clerks and administrative assistants), are likely to face significant displacement
                                    of their activities by automation, while doctors, health aides, and other care providers and
                                    professionals including engineers and business specialists are less likely to experience as
                                    much displacement.

                                    The current level of educational requirements for occupations tends to be correlated with
                                    the likelihood that their activities can be automated. The technical automation potential for
                                    occupations requiring less than a high school diploma is 55 percent, whereas for those with
                                    a college degree, that potential is far lower, at just 22 percent. Occupations requiring some
                                    post-secondary education generally include work activities that are less automatable than
                                    those requiring a high school diploma and some experience, and so on (Exhibit 4).

                            Countries and companies have compelling reasons to embrace automation, since the
                            technologies will give a much-needed boost to productivity in the global economy.
                            Depending on the pace of adoption, however, automation technologies in the workplace
                            could displace workers in a wide range of sectors; in our most aggressive scenario for early
                            adoption, almost one-third of work hours in the global economy could be automated by
                            2030—although other, later adoption scenarios have less dramatic outcomes in that time
                            frame. Economic and social factors beyond technical feasibility affect adoption, and these
                            could lead to strong variations in adoption rates among sectors and countries. Under these
                            circumstances, what will be the future of work? Will the global economy create enough
                            additional jobs to offset those lost to automation, regardless of when adoption takes place?
                            And if so, what sort of jobs will those be, requiring which skills, and paying what wages? In
                            the next two chapters, we highlight findings of our analysis of future labor demand and the
                            complex workforce transitions that automation will likely set in motion.

2. LESSONS FROM HISTORY ON
TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT
For centuries, the arrival of new technology in the workplace has sparked workers’ fears—
and, sometimes, violent backlash. Already in 1589, England’s Queen Elizabeth I refused to
grant a patent to a stocking frame invented by William Lee because she was supposedly
concerned about the effect on hand knitters.29 In the early 19th century, textile workers in
Britain and France smashed automated looms in their factories and printers struck to protest
the arrival of steam-powered presses.30

Leading thinkers in the past, from David Ricardo to Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes,
raised concerns about the effect of technological change on employment, and opinion polls
show that anxiety has come to the fore again, amid rapid advances in robotics and artificial
intelligence.31 A number of prominent academics and technologists argue that the latest
wave of automation technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, will
be particularly disruptive to the workforce.32

In this chapter, we examine the historical impact of technology on employment, skills, and
wages. History does not necessarily repeat itself, but it does provide valuable context
and possible lessons for the future of labor demand in a time of automation. Among those
lessons are that technological innovation in the past has enabled the creation of many
more new jobs than it has destroyed, raising productivity, spurring sustained increases in
living standards, and bringing about a shift in the balance of work and leisure. However,
the transition has not always been smooth: for example, real wages stagnated for nearly
50 years in 19th century England during the Industrial Revolution there, and only picked up
again at a time of substantial social policy reforms. Charles Dickens among other novelists
used the harsh realities of everyday life for displaced and other workers as material for
his works. History also shows that robust aggregate demand and economic growth are
essential for job creation. New technologies have raised productivity growth, enabling firms
to lower prices for consumers, pay higher wages, or distribute profits to shareholders. This
stimulates demand across the economy, boosting job creation.

     The most celebrated anti-technology protests were conducted by “Luddites” in Nottingham, England, in
     1811, but they were not alone. French textile workers staged an uprising in a silk factory in Lyons in 1831

     Political economist David Ricardo worried in the early 19th century that machines would make labor
     redundant, while Karl Marx in the 1850s foresaw an era when the means of labor would be transformed
     by “an automatic system of machinery.” In 1930, John Maynard Keynes coined the term “technological
     unemployment” to describe a situation in which innovation that economized on the use of labor outstripped
     the pace at which new jobs could be created, in a “temporary phase of maladjustment.” David Ricardo, On
     the principles of political economy and taxation, 1817; Karl Marx, Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of
     political economy, 1858; John Maynard Keynes, “Economic possibilities for our grandchildren,” in Essays in
     Persuasion, Macmillan 1933.

                           Since the First Industrial Revolution began in England in the 18th century, the economies
                           of Europe, the United States, and other countries have undergone two profound waves
                           of structural change. Mechanization enabled a revolution in agriculture and in industry,

employment
between 1880               The employment shifts accompanying this process of structural transformation have been
and 1920                   very large. In the United States, for instance, the agriculture share of employment declined
                           from 58 percent of total employment in 1850 to 2.5 percent of employment today (Exhibit 5).
                           In just 40 years, between 1880 and 1920, the share of agricultural employment declined
                           25 percentage points. During the same decades, other sectors were being transformed by
                           mechanization and electrification as well: the share of miners and household workers, for
                           example maids and servants, also declined, although these shifts affected fewer workers.
                           Since 1960, when the second wave of structural transformation began, manufacturing fell
                           from 27 percent of total US employment to 9 percent today, as automation and global trade
                           transformed manufacturing and as demand for services exploded.

                           The patterns are broadly similar in other countries, although there are some notable
                           differences in the pace. China’s shifting sector mix in recent years has been especially rapid:
                           agricultural employment fell as a share of total employment by 32 percentage points in just
                           25 years, from 60 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2015.34 In Mexico, the agriculture share
                           of employment declined from 52 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 2015, although in contrast
                           with China, the decline has been gradual and continuous across decades. In Japan,
                           agricultural employment declined from a 31 percent share of total employment in 1960 to
                           3.5 percent in 2015, while manufacturing’s share of total employment dropped from its peak
                           in 1973 of 25 percent to 13 percent in 2015.

                           Throughout these large shifts of workers across occupations and industries, overall
                           employment as a share of the population has generally continued to grow. New industries
                           and occupations emerged to absorb workers displaced by technology, although as we
                           discuss below, the transition has not always been smooth.

                           Magnitude of potential job dislocation from automation through 2030 is
                           not unprecedented
                           When we compare historical sector employment to potential labor displacement from our
                           automation model, we see that even in the earliest automation scenario, future rates of labor
                           displacement from automation within specific sectors are not unprecedented. For example,
                           our analysis shows that a number of sectors in different countries, including agriculture
                           in China, Germany, and Japan, and manufacturing in the United States, have declined by
                           30 percent and more over a period of 15 years. Our analyses of scenarios of automation
                           displacement over the 15 years from 2016 to 2030 are within the same range (Exhibit 6).

                            History shows that the adoption of technological innovation can act as a powerful stimulus
                            on the economy and jobs. The overall effect of mechanization has been to create jobs on an
                            unprecedented scale. Machines allow workers to produce more, thereby raising productivity

women, from 1950            even as the size of the workforce has grown. In the United States, for example, female
to late1990s                employment almost doubled as a proportion of working-age women from 32 percent in
                            1950 to 60 percent in the late 1990s before falling back to 57 percent today. Yet this major
                            shift did not reduce overall employment. Indeed, employment grew: the total number
                            of people employed in the United States more than doubled from 65 million in 1960 to
                            152 million in 2017, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar trends
                            have occurred in other countries.

                            Technology enables productivity growth, raises incomes, and stimulates new
                            consumer demand
                            Evidence of the economy-wide positive correlation among technology, productivity, and
                            employment can be seen in the aggregate data across countries. Within an industry,
                            machines and automation can sometimes contribute to employment declines. For instance,
                            in the United States, one recent study found that every industrial robot deployed results in
                            the reduction of six human workers within the surrounding metropolitan area.35 However,
                            when looking at the total economy, we see the opposite effect: rising productivity (often
                            from technology) is usually accompanied by employment growth, not decline. This is
                            because automation raises productivity, which in turn increases incomes of workers and/or
                            shareholders. Higher incomes are spent, creating demand for goods and services across
                            the economy.36

                            When there has been a tradeoff between employment growth and labor productivity
                            growth, it has been short-lived. Looking at the United States since 1960, for example, our
                            analysis shows that employment and productivity both grew in 79 percent of individual
                            years, while productivity grew while employment declined in 12 percent of years. But
                            both employment and productivity grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and
                            100 percent of rolling 10-year periods. This phenomenon is also seen in other countries.
                            In China, employment and productivity both increased in 77 percent of individual years
                            but 98 percent of the 10-year periods between 1960 and 2016. In Germany, which saw
                            unemployment rise after reunification, employment and productivity grew in 68 percent of
                            individual years but 81 percent of rolling 10-year periods (Exhibit 7).

                                   Even as productivity growth leads to rising incomes, technological innovation can also
                                   reduce prices and increase the quality of goods and services.37 This combination can cause
                                   demand for a product to soar, resulting in higher employment even within the sector itself.
                                   The Ford Model T provides one historical example. The assembly line dramatically improved
                                   the productivity of the process of manufacturing automobiles. Exhibit 8 shows that over
                                   a six-year period, the number of Model Ts produced per worker annually nearly tripled,
                                   from eight to 21. The surge in productivity, combined with increasing economies of scale,
                                   enabled Ford to reduce the price from $950 in 1909 to $440 in 1915. As a result, the number
                                   of cars sold increased 30-fold, and employment rose from 1,655 to 18,892.38

                                   TECHNOLOGY DISPLACES SOME WORK BUT CREATES NEW JOBS,
                                   SOMETIMES IN UNFORESEEN WAYS
                                   It is easy to see which jobs are being destroyed by technology, but difficult to imagine
                                   which jobs will be created by it. Telephone switchboard operators have gone the way of
                                   lamplighters in the 19th century, but how many of them, lamenting the loss of their jobs,
                                   could have imagined the development of the smartphone—and the huge global industry
                                   employing tens of millions of people that has sprung up around it? More than 50 years
                                   ago, Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase “creative destruction” to describe this age-old
                                   phenomenon in which the emergence of new technology “destroys” jobs by rendering them
                                   obsolete, and “creates” new jobs in their wake.39

                     Not only does technology create new occupations, it can also change existing occupations
                     in unpredictable ways. After ATMs were introduced in the United States, for example, the
                     number of bank tellers actually rose, as banks competed to provide higher-quality services
                     to customers and the role of tellers changed from dispensing cash to providing broader
                     advice and services. The reduction in the number of tellers per branch enabled banks to
                     open more branches and make retail banking more convenient for customers, which drove
                     the demand for more tellers.40 From 1991 to 2007, the number of ATMs and tellers in the
                     United States both increased. However, that trend reversed as Internet banking and the
                     2008 financial crisis resulted in cutbacks in bank branches and tellers.

                     To better understand the pattern of job creation and destruction, we conducted case
                     studies of two technologies in the United States—personal computers and automobiles—
                     to estimate the number and types of jobs lost to the new technology and the number of
                     new jobs created. In both cases, our research reveals that while some work activities
                     declined, sometimes rapidly, new types of work activities were created. The net impact of
                     both technologies was highly positive, creating new jobs that made up 10 percent of total
                     employment over four decades.

                     The personal computer enabled the creation of 15.8 million net new jobs since
                     1980, accounting for 10 percent of employment
                     Computer-related industries such as computer and data processing services and computer
                     and related equipment manufacturing have been growing rapidly since the 1970s. Microsoft
                     and Apple were founded in that decade. Laptop computers came on the market in the early
                     1980s, and this century has seen the rapid rise of smartphones and tablets.

                     The growth of computers has generated significant employment: in the United States,
                     we estimate that computers have enabled the net creation of 15.8 million jobs since 1970
                     (Exhibit 9). We arrive at this figure by tallying employment gains and losses in different
                     sectors and occupations. We find that in total, we can identify 3.5 million jobs destroyed by
                     the introduction of computers, including those in typewriter manufacturing, secretarial work,
                     and bookkeeping. But at least 19.3 million were created in a wide range of occupations
                     and industries.

                     When digital editing made it easier and more efficient for authors to type and then directly
                     edit their own work, computers eliminated the need for people specialized in editing
                     and re-typing documents. Employment for typists and secretaries fell significantly, by
                     1.4 million between 1990 and 2015, even as the overall US workforce grew. The number of
                     bookkeeping clerks also declined, by an annual average of 3 percent in the same period, as
                     accounting moved from physical books to accounting software, resulting in nearly 900,000
                     fewer jobs.

                     But many new jobs were also created. These include jobs in the computer manufacturing
                     industry and supplier industries (such as semiconductors), as well as employment in
                     occupations enabled by computers (IT systems administrators, computer scientists in other
                     industries), and in occupations that use computers (customer service call centers, which
                     barely existed before computers, and ecommerce). Of this total, only about 1 percent of net
                     new jobs came directly from the computer manufacturing industry and only 3 percent came
                     from supplier industries.

                                 A larger share of employment gains has come in professions enabled by computers
                                 (18 percent of net employment created). This includes the entire computer software and
                                 services industry, with companies such as Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft. This industry
                                 employs three million people in the United States, including software and app developers,
                                 computer scientists, and managers and office workers.

                                 Because of the multitude of applications of the computer, over 75 percent of net
                                 employment generated has been in occupations that use computers. For example,
                                 employment of computer scientists in finance, manufacturing, business services, and
                                 other industries grew rapidly, by an annual average of about 7 percent, between 1980
                            Similar version
                                 and 2015. In the same period, employment of financial managers and specialists able to

                            in ESuse spreadsheets to track and analyze large amounts of company data grew by about
                                 3 percent annually on average (see Box 2, “The impact of personal computer and Internet
                                 technologies on information analysts”).

                                   Box 2. The impact of personal computer and Internet technologies on
                                   information analysts
                                   In theory, at least, many information analysts might have been replaced by the rise of the
                                   Internet, which makes collecting data and information vastly more efficient, and computers
                                   that enable rapid and complex computations. After all, much of their work in the 1980s,
                                   before these technologies were widespread, has since been automated.1

                                   In fact, the opposite has happened. Computers and the Internet automated activities such
                                   as basic mathematics and information gathering, yet the number of information analysts
                                   soared nonetheless. As computers became more efficient, the cost of obtaining high-quality
                                   information dropped. Rather than decreasing demand for analysts, this stimulated the
                                   appetite for more insightful and low-cost analysis, and the number of analysts quintupled
                                   from around 400,000 in 1980 to about two million today (Exhibit 10).

                                   The jobs of analysts have changed as well. With information and data more easily
                                   accessible, analysts can focus on making sense of—and sharing—information rather than
                                   gathering it.

                            As computer adoption increased, computer use was correlated with higher wages;
                            employees in these occupations often acquired new skills to use computers, and could
                            demand higher wage premiums.41 For example, graphic designers took over the jobs of
                            typesetters and started doing a wider range of tasks. Wages increased accordingly as they
                            learned how to use new software and developed higher value skills.42

                            The automobile’s largest employment effect has been in enabled industries
                            The introduction of the automobile created 6.9 million net new jobs in the United States
                            between 1910 and 1950, based on our estimates.43 This is equivalent to 11 percent of the
                            US workforce in 1950. This includes 7.5 million jobs created, and 623,000 jobs destroyed.
                            Workers displaced by the automobile include manufacturers of wagons, carriages,
                            harnesses and saddles, and of railroad equipment and carriages, as well as supplier
                            industries such as horse breeders and metal work occupations, and enabled industries
                            such as livery services and message boys.

                            Ten times as many jobs were created in a host of new occupations. About 10 percent were
                            within the auto manufacturing industry (Exhibit 11). Three times as many jobs were in the
                            automotive supply chain, including metal parts manufacturers, warehouses and logistics,
                            and wholesalers. An even larger share of jobs was created in enabled industries and
                            occupations that use the automobile. Enabled industries include auto dealerships, auto
                            repair, gas stations, and convenience stores, and these account for around 30 percent of
                            net new jobs created. Utilizer industries, meanwhile, include transportation and logistics
                            occupations, and account for about 25 percent of employment generated.

                            If we had extended our analysis beyond 1950, we would have seen the continuing
                            transformative impact of the automobile on the economy and society. Building of the US
                            interstate highway system began in the 1950s, transforming logistics networks. This in
                            turn gave rise to the concept of the “family vacation,” long-haul car trips and demand for
                            roadside attractions, motels, and campgrounds. Drive-in movies and restaurants, shopping
                            malls on the edges of towns, and parking lots sprang up. The automobile also enabled
                            growth in suburbs, as workers could commute to jobs from locations outside urban public
                            transportation networks.

                            THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED HAS DECLINED, WHILE LEISURE TIME
                            HAS RISEN


50%
                            While past technological disruptions did not reduce the amount of work available to
                            people, they nonetheless had one significant effect: a decline in the average number of
                            hours worked per week—and conversely an increase in the amount of leisure enjoyed by

                            individuals. Already in 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted the advent of greater leisure:

and United States
since 1870                  In hindsight, Keynes was right: the average number of hours worked each week by
                            employed workers has declined significantly in the past 150 years, giving workers more
                            time for leisure. In 1870, workers in Germany, Sweden, and the United States averaged
                            between 62 and 70 hours each week; in the United Kingdom, which was already shifting

                                 from agriculture to industry, the average worker put in 57 hours per week (Exhibit 12). By
                                 2015, these figures had fallen by roughly half, to around 35 hours in Germany, Sweden, and
                                 the United Kingdom and 38.6 hours in the United States. Hours worked have continued
                                 to decline as the workforce shifted from manufacturing to services in the past 50 years.
                                 In OECD countries, the average hours work declined to 36 hours in 2015 from 42 hours
                                 between 1960 and 1980.45 This trend is especially pronounced in Australia, Denmark,
                                 Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

                                  The decline in average hours worked reflects the productivity improvements that have
                                  compounded over the years, allowing people to work less per week and yet still support
                                  growing economies. Differences between countries reflect different labor policies and social
                                  institutions governing the number of expected hours of work per week and vacation days. In
                                  the early 20th century, labor unions in the United States and in Europe pushed for national
                                  policies to cap the work week at 40 hours (which eventually became an International
                                  Labour Organization standard). In European countries such as France and Germany, a
                                  second wave of working-hour reductions took place in the 1980s and 1990s; in France, the
                                  government lowered the official work week to 35 hours—and today there is some evidence

                           that French people would work more if they could.46 Since 1960, the total hours worked has
                           declined by 26 percent in Germany, 8 percent in Italy, and 7 percent in France.

                           The decline in average hours worked also reflects the steady rise of part-time employment
                           across countries. The highest proportion of part-time work is in the Netherlands
                           (39 percent of employed persons), the United Kingdom (24 percent), and Germany and
                           Japan (22 percent).47 Part-time work is often preferred for a variety of reasons by students,
                           caregivers, and people nearing retirement, but also by some employers in markets where
                           rigid labor market policies make full-time hiring economically unattractive. In the past
                           decade, the number of people in the United States and Europe who earn money in the
                           independent workforce—as freelancers, independent contractors, self-employed, and
                           workers in the “gig” economy—has grown, to an estimated 162 million.48 Many of these
                           individuals work less than a full-time schedule.

                           As leisure time increases, people spend money on hobbies, entertainment, and other
                           personal services, giving rise to entire new industries that in turn create jobs. Skiing, golfing,
                           tourism, crafting, and do-it-yourself home projects are a just a few industries that have
                           sprung from the new leisure economy. The number of jobs involved is significant: globally, as
                           many as 292 million people are employed directly or indirectly by tourism—one in every ten
                           jobs on the planet.49

                           THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON WAGES AND SKILLS
For some English           Adjusting the economy to new technological disruptions may take time, and can have
workers during the         significant repercussions for both skills and wages. In the first half of the 19th century,
early 19th century,        during the First Industrial Revolution in England, the steam engine and other technologies
wages stagnated            increased the productivity of unskilled workers and enabled them to undertake work
                           previously carried out by higher-skill, and higher-paid, workers including craftsmen and
or fell for

                           artisans. Across the economy, mechanization raised output per worker. However, real
                           wages stagnated for roughly 50 years, from 1790 until 1840 (Exhibit 13). During this period,
                           first noted by economist Friedrich Engels in 1845, profits as a share of national income
                           rose and the labor share of income declined.50 After 1850, real wages began rising in line
                           with productivity increases, and by the late 1800s wage growth exceeded productivity
                           growth. But for nearly half a century, wage growth was nil and real living standards of
                           workers declined. The plight of some workers provided material for Charles Dickens’s bleak
                           depictions in his novels, and led the English poet William Blake to decry factories as “dark,
                           satanic mills.”51 The turnaround in the relationship between wages and output came at a
                           time of substantial reform of existing structures including the right to unionize, limitations on

                                An MGI survey of 16,000 Europeans in eight countries showed that a majority was willing to make tradeoffs,
                                including working more hours per week in exchange for more income and better services. This willingness to
                                increase working hours was especially pronounced in France, where the workweek was officially lowered to

                                    The growing mechanization led to a shift in the skills of the workforce and affected semi-
                                    skilled artisans negatively. Economic historians have documented the consequences for
                                    previously well-paid workers such as hand-loom weavers, whose income tumbled in the
                                    1820s, leading to immiseration of many, even as the invention of automated looms lifted
                                    other, unskilled workers out of poverty.53 At the same time, the share of unskilled labor in the
                                    British workforce increased, from 20 percent in the late 16th century to nearly 40 percent
                                    in the early 19th century.54 This “deskilling” of the workforce occurred in agriculture and
                                    industry alike, prompted by land concentration that enabled mechanized agriculture and the
                                    shift from artisans’ workshops to factory production in industry. During this period there was
                                    also some growth in the share of skilled workers such as machine erectors and operators,
                                    who were needed to facilitate the Industrial Revolution.

                                    More recently, academic research shows that local labor markets, including in the United

                     suggests that increasing structural unemployment of non-college US whites of the past two
                     decades—driven by automation and offshoring in manufacturing, among other things—may
                     have contributed to rising morbidity rates.56

                     Whether the experience of technological disruption in the past is relevant for economies in
                     the future can be debated. In Chapter 4 of this report, we present new analysis of the impact
                     of automation today on the demand for different types of skills and discuss the potential
                     impact on wages. Even if the particulars of the historical experience turn out to differ from
                     conditions today, one lesson seems pertinent: although economies adjust to technological
                     shocks, the transition period is measured in decades, not years, and the rising prosperity
                     may not be shared by all.

                     AUTOMATION TODAY: COULD THIS TIME BE DIFFERENT?
                     Despite the reassuring lessons from history on the long-run impact of automation on
                     employment, some technology experts argue that automation today will not behave like
                     previous technology waves. They cite a number of reasons that the future may bring more
                     disruption to workers than in the past, including the ability of machines to perform work
                     activities requiring cognitive capabilities, the rate of progress in new innovations, and a
                     potential future in which machines teach themselves to improve at particular tasks without
                     much human intervention.57 Many economists, however, tend to view automation as the
                     next wave of technological advancement and point out that an equilibrium between the
                     supply and demand of jobs in labor markets has always been reached historically, even if the
                     transition period may be difficult.58

                     In part, the discord between the two points of view may be caused by the lack of a common
                     language: what exactly could be different about automation compared with previous
                     technologies? What time frame are we considering? In our research we looked at a range
                     of arguments on both sides and examined the evidence for both the scope of automation’s
                     impact and its nature across multiple dimensions. This framework is useful for disentangling
                     the different elements of technological disruption and assessing the ways in which today’s
                     technology may—or may not—have a different impact than in the past.

                     We conclude that in many respects, the impact of automation on employment today is
                     not likely to be different than in the past, particularly if we look back centuries, to the First
                     Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s. But we have identified two ways in which automation,
                     robotics, and AI could diverge from earlier waves of technology disruption: the speed at
                     which scientific advances are being made, if the accelerated rate of progress in machine
                     learning and AI continues, and the potential to displace a higher share of the workforce in
                     a relatively short period of time, particularly if the adoption of automation is rapid across
                     multiple sectors of the economy.

48   McKinsey Global Institute         2. Lessons from history on technology and employment


                            Rate of technological innovation
                            Could be faster than the past
                            In Chapter 1 we noted the rapidity of recent technological innovation as a result of the
                            development of deep learning and reinforcement-learning techniques based on neural
                            networks; the availability of exponentially increasing computing capacity that is accessible
                            to users via the cloud; and the sheer volume and variety of data generated that can be
                            used to train machine learning models. Advocates of the argument that automation today is
                            fundamentally different in its scope point to this acceleration of innovation as evidence of a
                            real break with the past.

                            Those who disagree, however, point to Moore’s Law, named for Gordon Moore, a co-
                            founder of Intel, who in 1965 noted that the number of transistors incorporated in a
                            computer chip would approximately double every 24 months—which became the basic
                            business model for the semiconductor industry for the following decades.59 The shrinking of
                            transistors in semiconductors improved computing speed and capacity and helped usher
                            in the internet era, as well as the mobile phone revolution and the cloud. However, the rate of
                            progress in shrinking transistors has slowed, and some scientists project that without a new
                            computing model, future advances may run out. Moreover, AI veterans point to previous
                            eras when what seemed to be fast-moving advances in AI gave way to frustrating lulls. AI
                            dates back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing suggested that computers could communicate
                            as well as humans and Princeton students including Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds
                            built the first artificial neural network using 300 vacuum tubes and a war-surplus gyropilot.
                            After the initial excitement, funding slumped in the 1970s as research backers—primarily
                            the US government—tired of waiting for practical AI applications and cut appropriations for
                            further work. Another lull followed in the 1990s.60

                            Our view is that the recent technical advances, enabling machines to read lips or X-rays
                            more proficiently than human experts, are indeed remarkable and that if this pace of
                            innovation continues rather than encountering a new AI “winter,” the rate of automation
                            innovation could indeed be faster than in the past. If so, the potential disruption of workforce
                            models and displacement of labor could be greater than past technological revolutions.

                            Rate of technological adoption
                            Faster than 100 years ago, but no evidence of acceleration in recent decades
                            Even if technological innovations are occurring more rapidly, the impact on workers
                            will be different only if the diffusion and adoption of new technologies also accelerates.
                            Some researchers say this is the case, pointing to examples such as landline telephones,
                            electrification, or the automobile. Indeed, while it took almost a century for landline phones
                            to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand falls off, mobile phones in some
                            markets reached that point in just 20 years and smartphones in even less time.61 One
                            commonly found reference is the speed with which certain online videos on YouTube or
                            smartphone games such as Angry Birds or Pokemon Go reach a certain threshold of
                            downloads—50 million, 100 million, or more.62 Based on measures of gross numbers,
                            for example, of people adopting a technology, you could say that adoption rates have
                            accelerated. However, it is also worth considering adoption rates when measured
                            using percentages.

                     Looking at only the last 60 years, our review of the historical rates of adoption of 25 previous
                     technologies shows that the time from commercial availability to 80 percent adoption has
                     tended to fall within a relatively constant range: between approximately eight and 28 years.
                     For 50 percent adoption, the range is five to 16 years. The technologies reviewed date back
                     to TVs in the 1950s, and include recent examples of cell phones, customer relationship
                     management software, and lithium-ion cell batteries. This range of times for adoption was
                     observed for both hardware-based technologies that are capital-intensive and require
                     physical installation; and technologies that are available purely online. Technologies with
                     the fastest adoption rates include stents, airbags, MRIs, TVs and online air booking, while
                     slower adoption categories include dishwashers and pacemakers from the 1960s, and
                     cellphones in the 2000s. Even highly popular and widely-used social media applications do
                     not achieve a high level of adoption faster than technologies in previous eras. Facebook is
                     one example: it was launched in 2004 and quickly achieved worldwide success. Yet even
                     by mid-2016, when it had about 1.7 billion users globally, it was still far from full adoption,
                     even outside China.63 Moreover, it was not the first social network, and so the adoption
                     period could be calculated as being even longer—since the advent of the first modern
                     social network, Six Degrees, which launched in 1997, or Classmates.com, which launched
                     in 1995.64

                     Our view is thus that there is no evidence that technological adoption has yet accelerated
                     over the last 60 years, when measured in percentages, although, not surprisingly, diffusion
                     is faster than it was for technologies introduced in the early 20th century.

                     Breadth of sectors in which work can be automated
                     Not different from the past
                     Some commentators say that today’s automation is different from the past because it has
                     the potential to transform work in multiple sectors simultaneously. They argue that the
                     largest technological disruptions of the past have been the move out of agriculture or, more
                     recently, from manufacturing into services. Advocates of the “this time things are different”
                     argument point to the pervasiveness of automation technologies as being different, in that
                     they will affect multiple sectors of the economy—from finance to retail to manufacturing to
                     transportation—simultaneously.65

                     As points of comparison, one can consider the application of some technologies in the
                     past, such as electricity or computers, which also transformed work across multiple sectors
                     of the economy simultaneously. Electrification transformed household lighting, heating,
                     and refrigeration; it enabled stores and factories to open for longer hours; and it gave birth
                     to mass production. Similarly, computers transformed business services, finance, and
                     retail and gave birth to the Internet and mobile computing. The steam engine drove the
                     Industrial Revolution, upending numerous sectors from weaving to printing, for example.
                     Between 1910 and 1950, successive waves of innovation also proved highly pervasive, from
                     automobiles to assembly lines.

                     Our view is that little is new about the breadth of impact of automation technologies.

                     Share of jobs in the economy that be automated by 2030
                     Could be higher than past technologies if adoption is rapid
                     Even if past technological innovations transformed work in multiple sectors of the economy,
                     today’s automation could affect a larger share of work. Proponents of this view point out
                     that some sector employment shifts have been extremely large—for example, the rapid
                     transitioning out of agricultural employment in China, or the steep decline in US agriculture in

                            the 20th century. The potential impact on demand for current work activities in some sectors
                            as a result of automation today could likewise be very large. Viewed over a 15-year period,
                            our automation model suggests that roughly half of the existing work in countries such as
                            Germany, Japan, and the United States could be displaced by 2030 if automation adoption
                            is at the most rapid end of our modeling. In the past, also looking at 15-year periods, our
                            analysis shows that as much as 30 percent of jobs were displaced in historical episodes—in
                            other words, lower than our most rapid automation scenario but not of a completely different
                            order of magnitude.

                            Our view is thus that, if automation adoption is very rapid, it could potentially displace a
                            greater percentage of work in some advanced economies in the next 15 years than we have
                            seen in the past.

                            Types and complexity of tasks that can be automated
                            Every wave of automation affects more complex tasks
                            Alongside the scope of automation’s impact, its very nature has sparked discussion about
                            differences between technological change today and in the past. One frequently-cited
                            argument concerns the type of tasks that AI in particular now can accomplish with prowess,
                            from driving trucks to creating music and art to playing championship Go. The power of
                            algorithms to take on activities requiring cognitive capabilities and creativity is held up as a
                            fundamental break with previous technologies.66

                            Skeptics point out, however, that this is not the first time that machines have been able
                            to carry out tasks requiring cognitive capabilities. Every new wave of automation seems
                            remarkable at the time. From the 1980s, with the birth of computerized spreadsheets,
                            machines have taken on ever more sophisticated tasks that previously required human
                            brainpower, from manipulating large quantities of data and alphabetizing lists or doing
                            complex calculations to anticipating the words your fingers are about to type on a
                            smartphone. While the tasks themselves have changed, our view is that the ability of
                            machines to acquire such capabilities is not in itself new. While significant progress has
                            been made in specific “narrow” AI applications, formidable multi-decade-long technological
                            challenges must still be overcome before machines can match human performance across
                            the range of cognitive activities and approach “artificial general intelligence”—which would
                            indeed be a break with historical precedent.

                            Skill bias of technical change
                            Today’s automation could complement both high- and low-skill workers
                            Technological innovation has affected workers in different ways in the past. As already
                            noted, the steam engine and other technologies introduced during the Industrial Revolution
                            in Europe and the United States in the 19th century increased the productivity of unskilled or
                            low-skill workers and enabled them to undertake work previously carried out by high-skill,
                            and higher-paid, workers including artisans such as hand-loom weavers. In the academic
                            literature, technological change was thus considered to be biased toward enabling low-skill
                            workers at the expense of high-skill ones.

                            In our era, the opposite has happened: computers and factory-floor robots have tended to
                            increase the productivity and complement the work of high-skill workers, while machines
                            have substituted for the programmable and routine tasks that had been undertaken by
                            low-skill workers, including those working on assembly lines or as switchboard operators.67

                     This is known as skill-biased technical change. Some economists view the effects of
                     technological change and technology-enabled globalization in recent decades as a
                     significant driver of inequality.68

                     We do not have firm evidence yet on whether automation today will tend to be more skill-
                     biased or unskill-biased in its impact. Our analysis of how automation will affect skills,
                     detailed in Chapter 4, suggests that workers of all skill and educational levels will be
                     affected. Some technologies might enable lower-skill workers to replace higher-skill ones—
                     such as nurses who can perform some of the more routine tasks of doctors with the aid of
                     diagnostic tools. Other technologies will complement high-skill workers and enable them
                     to command even greater power in the marketplace—for instance surgical robots or AI
                     algorithms that can suggest new investment strategies.

                     Impact on high-wage vs. low-wage work
                     Both will be affected
                     A final dimension on which technological change could be different today is its impact on
                     workers at different wage levels. One of the frequently-cited concerns about automation
                     is that machines could replace activities of high-wage jobs previously considered “safe,”
                     including experts in financial services, some types of doctors, and lawyers.

                     While our analysis of automation’s impact on wages, also in Chapter 4, suggests that a
                     range of high-wage occupations could be affected, there is ample historical precedent
                     for this, including the hand-loom weavers in 19th-century England who suffered a steep
                     decline in their livelihoods after the arrival of mechanized looms, which allowed lower-wage
                     and lower-skill workers to produce more cloth, faster, and less expensively.69 We therefore
                     conclude that today’s automation is unlikely to be different from the past on this dimension.

                                                                           •••

                     In 1930, at the height of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes wrote, “We are
                     suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid
                     changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another.”
                     As many do today, he saw the speed of technological change as something formidable,
                     an era of progress and invention incomparable to any that had come before—yet also as a
                     time of painful transition for many. In the 1960s, a US national commission on technology,
                     automation, and economic progress established by President Lyndon B. Johnson
                     concluded that, “the basic fact is that technology eliminates jobs, not work. It is the
                     continuous obligation of economic policy to match increases in productive potential with
                     increases in purchasing power and demand. Otherwise, the potential created by technical
                     progress runs to waste in idle capacity, unemployment, and deprivation.”70 The question
                     for us today is whether, this time, the transitions will be larger and more painful than ever,
                     and indeed how demand for human labor will evolve. In this chapter, we have described
                     the historical evidence showing that employment remains strong even in periods of
                     technological ferment. In the following chapters, we look at the trends that can create
                     demand for tens of millions of new jobs in the global economy over the next decade and
                     more, even as robotics and AI increasingly make their way into our daily work lives, and what
                     the implications will be for sectors, occupations, skills, and wages.

                    3. JOBS GAINED: SCENARIOS FOR
                    EMPLOYMENT GROWTH
                    While automation will displace some workers and transform occupations, we also know that
                    new and additional work will be created in the next decade and beyond. What is less clear
                    is how job growth net of automation will vary by occupation, and under what conditions
                    there will be enough new jobs to offset the work that is lost as robotics, artificial intelligence,
                    and other technologies assume a greater role in the workplace. Predicting all the jobs that
                    will exist in the future is an impossible task, yet even without a crystal ball, it is possible to
                    identify some sources of future labor demand.

                    In this chapter, we discuss two different analyses that shed light on these questions. To
                    understand some of the occupations and types of jobs likely to be in demand in 2030, we
                    model seven specific global trends that we expect will be significant drivers of job creation.
                    To inform the impact of automation on aggregate employment, we conduct a second
                    analysis using the McKinsey Global Growth Model, which is a multi-country macroeconomic
                    model. This exercise allows us to model the dynamic effects of automation on productivity,
                    employment, and GDP growth in different scenarios. Automation has the potential to raise
                    productivity growth and GDP growth, but our analysis reveals that a key factor in whether
                    this will be achieved without large adverse effects on employment and wages is how quickly
                    displaced workers are reemployed in other jobs.

                    Both analyses reach broadly similar conclusions: although some workers will be displaced
                    by automation, other occupations will grow. While in the long-term the economy can adjust
                    to provide enough work for everyone, automation will prove challenging for tens of millions of
                    workers globally who will need to switch occupations. Depending on how societies manage
                    this transition, unemployment could rise in the medium-term and wages could be eroded.
                    Both the impact of automation and potential new sources of labor demand will play out
                    differently from country to country.

                    SEVEN GLOBAL TRENDS THAT WILL HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE OF WORK


250M
                    In seeking to identify potential sources of labor demand to 2030, we started with a long list
                    of trends and then prioritized seven for deeper analysis, based on high-level initial estimates
                    of their potential for job creation (see Box 3, “Our analysis of seven trends that will contribute
number of new
                    to future labor demand”). While there are many scenarios and sources of potential labor
jobs net of
                    demand we have not included, the seven trends we focus on in this report have the potential
automation that
                    to create demand for hundreds of millions of workers globally in the years to 2030, albeit
could be created    with significant variations among countries.
to 2030 by rising
incomes             For each trend, we model both the direct impact on employment and the indirect impact.
                    By direct jobs, we mean employment created in a sector itself (for instance, increased
                    spending on cars would create direct employment in the automobile manufacturing sector).
                    Indirect refers to employment created in all the sectors that supply goods and services to
                    the direct sector (for automobiles, indirect sectors would include spare parts, paint, leather,
                    etc.). We do not include induced effects, since some are captured directly by our rising
                    consumption trend.


                     Box 3. Our analysis of seven trends that will contribute to future
                     labor demand
                     We examine potential labor demand created between 2016 and 2030 as a
                     result of our seven trends, and compare that to the amount of work that could
                     be displaced by automation. Sizing methodology varies by trend; however we
                     capture direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each of our seven
                     catalysts, take into account the decline in hours worked per person, and factor
                     in globalization of work.1

                     For each occupation and sector, our incremental labor demand nets out
                     automation and other productivity gains. We then compare that incremental
                     labor demand with the reduction in labor demand due to automation against
                     a projected 2030 baseline of employment. This uses the model we developed
                     for our January 2017 report on automation, which also modeled ranges for the
                     pace of technology development, and for automation adoption.2

                     As well as calculating direct and indirect labor demand from our select trends,
                     we identified key occupations that will increase, and compare those with the
                     occupations in which work could decline as a result of automation.

                     For three of the seven—investment in infrastructure, investment in buildings,
                     and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency—we examined
                     two scenarios: a “trendline” scenario in which spending follows the observed
                     trends across countries and a “step-up” scenario, in which labor demand
                     increases as a result of societal and policy choices. For a fourth trend,
                     the increasing shift to market of services that were long done without
                     remuneration, we only examine a step-up scenario that assumes rising female
                     participation in the workforce.

                     Our analysis offers a static view of the potential labor demand that could
                     be created from the seven trends and does not factor in supply-demand
                     dynamics and feedback from factors such as changes in wage levels. (For
                     a more dynamic view, we used the McKinsey Global Growth Model, as we
                     discuss later in this chapter). The labor demand that our seven trends could
                     generate is potential, and whether this potential is captured will depend
                     on the choices and investments made by businesses, policy-makers, and
                     workers. The scenarios we construct do not take into account any sources
                     of labor demand outside of our seven trends. We do not model entirely new
                     industries, occupations, and activities that could be invented in the future, in
                     part enabled by technology; one study suggests that on average, 0.5 percent
                     of the workforce has been working in “new jobs” per year.3 We do not take into
                     account sectoral shifts in industries that are not directly related to automation
                     or these seven trends, such as the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not
                     model changes in work structure, such as the growth of the gig economy, or
                     activities within an occupation that could change as a result of technological
                     innovation. A more detailed discussion of our methodology can be found in the
                     technical appendix.

56   McKinsey Global Institute        3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth


                            Rising incomes in emerging economies will create large-scale new labor
                            demand as spending increases on consumer goods, health care, and education
                            Rising GDP per capita generates higher spending on consumer goods and services, health
                            care, and education, especially in emerging economies, and is the largest driver of labor
                            demand we have identified (Exhibit 14). Prior MGI research has found that rising per capita
                            consumption will generate about three-quarters of global consumption growth in the period
                            from 2015 to 2030, with population growth accounting for the remaining 25 percent.71 The
                            expanding consuming classes in emerging economies will drive most of this increase. As
                            incomes rise, consumers will spend disproportionally more on discretionary goods and
                            services such as automobiles, leisure, and accommodation and food services, but they will
                            also increase their non-discretionary spending on essentials such as food and clothing.72
                            We estimate that this higher consumer expenditure could create between about 250 million
                            and 280 million new full-time equivalent jobs, net of automation, across the 46 countries in
                            our model. The growth due to rising incomes can mitigate automation’s expected toll on
                            workers in retail and accommodation and food services; retail salespeople, food preparation
                            workers, and waiters see some of the largest boosts from higher consumer spending.

                            While this spending will create labor demand locally in sectors such as manufacturing,
                            retail, accommodation and food services, as well as personal services, it will also create
                            labor demand in other countries that export goods and services to these countries. We
                            assume that a proportion of demand for tradable goods such as apparel and furnishing will
                            continue to be served by countries rich in natural resources or with strong manufacturing or
                            service sectors. For the purposes of simplifying our modeling, we assume current shares of
                            global exports to remain constant; our model assumes that a country such as Germany will
                            continue to serve its 2014 share of 18.5 percent of all automotive exports in 2030.73

                            Higher GDP per capita is also generally correlated with higher expenditures in health care
                            and education. Access to health care, defined as the number of care providers (such as
                            physicians) per capita, could increase, especially in fast-growing emerging economies such
                            as India that currently have poor access to health care. We estimate that greater access to
                            health-care providers alone at all levels, including physicians and medical assistants, could
                            increase labor demand by 26 million to 43 million jobs (64 percent direct jobs in health-care
                            provision and 36 percent indirect jobs in other sectors).74 Demand for health-care providers
                            could increase the most in developing countries such as India and China with the highest
                            economic growth, although this may be contingent on the necessary provision of funding for
                            health care by governments and consumers.

                            In education, as with health care, economic development typically raises expenditures,
                            with a rise in gross enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, and falling
                            student-teacher ratios as quality improves. Our analysis suggests that these continuing
                            improvements could create demand for up to 37 million jobs (78 percent direct jobs in the
                            education sector and 22 percent indirect jobs in other sectors) globally by 2030, especially
                            in fast-growing emerging economies. We compared gross enrollment rates and student-
                            teacher ratios of students in primary education and conducted regression analyses against
                            GDP per capita. Using demographic projections to estimate the number of students by
                            country in 2030, we use our projections for gross enrollment rate and student-teacher
                            ratio to infer the potential labor demand for teachers and support staff across each
                            educational level.

                            Education as a creator of labor demand is most important for countries such as India,
                            which has low enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, high student-
                            teacher ratios, and high GDP per capita growth. In other countries including China, where
                            demographic trends are likely to have a smaller impact on labor demand in primary and
                            tertiary education, increases in gross enrollment rates for secondary education and
                            decreasing student-to-teacher ratios could imply an overall positive impact on labor demand
                            in education on an aggregate level. In advanced economies with aging populations, such as
                            Germany and Japan, there will be limited increase in labor demand from education as the
                            relative share of students in the overall population declines. However, as with health care,
                            the creation of these jobs would depend on the allocation of sufficient funding from public,
                            private, and philanthropic sectors.

                            The global trend of aging populations will create new and additional labor
                            demand for health care
                            The global population is continuing to rise and will likely reach 8.5 billion people by 2030.75 At
                            the same time, the population in many countries, both developed and developing, is aging:
                            by 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people aged 65 and above than there were in
                            2014.76 The aging trend is particularly acute in countries such as China, Germany, Italy, and
                            Japan; by 2030, about 25 percent of their population will be over 65, if current fertility rates
                            and immigration trends continue. This aging trend is less significant in developing countries
                            with younger populations such as India and Nigeria, which are experiencing a demographic
                            dividend, but it is also not restricted to advanced countries and China. Brazil, for example,
                            also has an aging population.77

                            As people age, their needs and spending patterns change—in particular, spending on health
                            care. For example, spending on hospital care for an 85-year-old American is more than five
                            times higher than for those 19 to 44 years old.78 We estimate that shifts in demographics
                            could create incremental demand for 51 million to 83 million workers globally (55 percent
                            direct and 45 percent indirect), especially for health care occupations that focus on taking
                            care of the elderly, such as home health aides, personal care aides, nursing assistants, and
                            so on.79 (As with all the estimates of incremental labor demand in this chapter, this figure is

                            In countries with aging populations such as Japan or China, our model suggests that aging
                            and related health-care needs could drive the creation of between 10 and 15 percent of net
                            new labor demand.

                           Technology development and deployment will create additional employment


6M
                           As technology development continues apace, the technology sector is expected to keep
                           growing rapidly, and this in turn will create incremental labor demand to develop and deploy
                           technology. The scale of this employment will be modest, however. Today, an estimated
new tech jobs
                           2.9 million people are employed in the US high tech sector, but this is only 1.9 percent of the
could be created
                           workforce. In Germany, about 2.4 percent of the workforce is in a high-tech occupation.
in India under our
scenarios                  Higher consumer spending on technology products and services, which typically rises
                           as incomes increase, and larger outlays by businesses that adopt technology to improve
                           productivity and improve output as they grow, are driving the increased spending on
                           software, hardware, and services. We modeled consumer and enterprise technology
                           spending per capita with rising GDP per capita across countries in 2014. Assuming that
                           the correlation holds, we estimate that by 2030 technology spend could increase by
                           $1.7 trillion to $2 trillion of which about 70 percent would be on information technology
                           (IT) services. This includes hardware/software support, outsourcing, IT consulting,
                           implementation, and internal IT services.80 This increased spending on technology will
                           create demand for 20 million to 46 million incremental workers (55 percent direct and
                           45 percent indirect) globally, net of automation. They will be a mix of high-skill workers such
                           as software engineers and electrical engineers as well as medium-skill workers including
                           web developers and electronic technicians. While IT services jobs such as computer
                           support specialists will remain largely local, demand for technology hardware and especially
                           software will likely be served by the global players, for example China, Germany, India, the
                           Netherlands, and the United States. More than half of all global tech jobs could be created
                           in these five countries. Of these, the largest demand will likely land in China and India, with
                           up to 13 million and six million jobs respectively. Both large economies are expected to go
                           through significant digitization in the next decade and beyond.

                           Investment in infrastructure and buildings can create new labor demand,
                           particularly in our step-up scenario
                           Infrastructure and buildings are two areas of historic underspending that may create
                           significant additional labor demand if action is taken to bridge infrastructure gaps and
                           overcome housing shortages. We modeled two scenarios: one in which annual investment
                           follows the observed trends across countries and one in which significant additional
                           investment is made to fill gaps in infrastructure and real estate.

                           Global infrastructure systems have not kept up with demand and housing shortages persist
                           in many countries. In critical areas of infrastructure such as transportation, water treatment,
                           and power grids, years of neglect are catching up with countries around the world. MGI
                           has found that, from 2016 to 2030, the world needs to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP in
                           economic infrastructure, or an average of $3.3 trillion per year, just to support expected
                           rates of growth, with emerging economies accounting for some 60 percent of that.81 In real
                           estate, as many as 330 million urban households in emerging and advanced economies live
                           in substandard housing or are financially stretched by housing costs.82

60         McKinsey Global Institute         3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth


                            Under our trendline scenario, in which investment in infrastructure and buildings continues
                            to follow patterns we have observed across countries, we note that spending on both of
                            these increases as countries develop economically. Thus, if countries were to increase their
                            spending on the current trajectory as they develop, our model shows that up to 53 million
                            gross new jobs could be created by continued spending on buildings, and up to 34 million
                            on infrastructure. Yet considerably more could be done than matching the investment levels
                            of other countries. Any additional efforts would consequently stimulate increased labor
                            demand, especially for middle-wage jobs that will otherwise be particularly affected by
                            automation in some advanced economies.

                            In our step-up scenario, we assume that the infrastructure gap has been closed, and that
                            infrastructure and building spending in 2030 is subsequently higher to sustain this higher
                            level of infrastructure stock and investment. We used infrastructure stock averages across
                            countries and real estate stock averages in the United States as a proportion of GDP to
                            estimate the infrastructure and housing investment needed in 2030 to keep pace with
                            projected economic growth.

                            This increased spending could create demand for an incremental 76 million to 134 million
                            workers from added investments in building structures and 38 million to 72 million
                            incremental workers from added investments in infrastructure. As with health care and
                            education, the creation of those jobs will depend on the allocation of necessary investments
                            by the private and public sector. About 30 to 40 percent of this labor demand could
                            come from India, which has currently under-invested in infrastructure, is going through
                            a process of large-scale urbanization, and would need to invest a significant amount to
                            keep pace with an ambitious target of 6.5 percent annual growth in GDP until 2030. The
                            currently unproductive nature of the construction sector in some emerging economies
                            such as Nigeria and Indonesia, coupled with low wage rates that may slow the adoption of
                            automation technologies, contribute to the labor-intensity of this sector. China has already
                            made significant investments in infrastructure over the past decade and our model shows
                            that it may not need as much incremental investment in 2030. Developed economies
                            including the United States and Germany could also invest in building new and repairing
                            or re-building existing infrastructure, creating additional employment opportunities in the
                            construction sector, particularly for middle-wage jobs.

                            Investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency
                            We similarly modeled two scenarios of labor demand for investment in new energy sources
                            and improving energy efficiency, depending on whether spending follows current trends or
                            is accelerated. The energy landscape is shifting rapidly as the cost of renewable energies,
                            such as wind and solar, falls sharply. A range of new technologies, from smart electricity
                            meters to Internet of Things sensors in oil rigs and advanced leaching techniques in mines,
                            is transforming both the production and the consumption of resources.83 The global policy
                            environment for energy has been shifting: with the conclusion of the Paris Agreement in
                            December 2016, countries around the world pledged to take measures that would keep the
                            global temperature rise this century below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.84
                            The International Energy Agency estimated in 2015 that to reach this goal could take up to
                            $16.5 trillion of investment by 2030, including increasing the share of renewables and by
                            making buildings, transportation, and technologies more energy efficient.

                                 While the United States has announced it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, many other signatory
                                 countries and even local governments in the United States have said they will continue to support it and meet
                                 the emission reduction targets that it established.

                     Governments including those in India and China are already spending more heavily on
                     renewable energy and climate adaptation measures. India, for instance, has announced
                     its intention to increase its share of renewable power to as much as 40 percent by 2030.85
                     Overall, our modeling indicates that moving to renewable energy and raising energy
                     efficiency at current trends could contribute up to seven million new jobs globally in 2030,
                     under our trendline scenario, and an additional four million to seven million under our
                     step-up scenario. (These jobs are incremental to the increase in employment in the power
                     sector driven by GDP per capita growth, which is modeled in our rising incomes driver
                     discussed above.)

                     In the transition to new energy sources, we model the potential job creation as countries
                     shift their capacity mix for electricity generation. Making these transitions will require
                     significant investments in manufacturing, construction, and operations and maintenance
                     of solar panels, wind turbines, and other equipment. Shifts in capacity mix create jobs in
                     two ways. First, large amounts of fixed investment are needed to increase the capacity
                     for the growing new energy source, creating jobs in manufacturing, construction, and
                     installation. Second, jobs may also be created in the decreasing energy sources through
                     decommissioning of fossil fuel and other generation facilities, as some countries decide to
                     shut down nuclear plants. Jobs associated with the ongoing operations and maintenance
                     of electricity generation are largely variable with capacity, so job levels here will depend on
                     relative labor intensity of operations and maintenance between energy types. Renewable
                     manufacturing is enjoying a remarkable period of productivity growth—across three
                     leading renewables manufacturers, employees declined by 65 percent on average per
                     gigawatt shipped in 2010 to 2014. If these productivity gains continue at an aggressive rate,
                     renewables manufacturing is likely to be a comparatively less labor-intensive part of the
                     renewables value-chain.

                     To attain the international goal of avoiding a rise of more than two degrees Celsius, the UN’s
                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has calculated that CO2 concentrations in the
                     earth’s atmosphere need to be stabilized at 450 parts per million. That will require targeted
                     policy choices, including accelerated transitions to renewables and increased spending
                     on energy efficiency measures, both in industry and in housing. This in turn could have a
                     significant impact on job creation. In our step-up scenario, using data from McKinsey &
                     Company’s Energy Insights, we modeled a more ambitious shift into renewables and higher
                     investment in energy efficiency, which would create an additional four million to seven million
                     jobs globally.86 High productivity and further automation potential in energy reduce the
                     opportunity for energy to have a transformative impact on the jobs story in many countries;
                     in the United States, less than 1 percent of all full-time equivalents in 2014 were in utilities
                     and mining. But major investments in renewable energy will be crucial to meeting global
                     climate change goals, which could create middle-wage jobs along the way.

                     “Marketization” of unpaid work could create new jobs
                     Today, much work done in households—from childcare to cooking and cleaning—is unpaid
                     and disproportionately performed by women. At least some of this work could be shifted
                     to paid employment through daycare or pre-kindergarten schooling programs and senior
                     care programs. Rising female labor participation rates could be one way to prompt this shift,
                     which economists call “marketization”; social decisions to expand government-supported
                     programs could be another (and those programs in turn might enable higher female labor
                     force participation). In recent years, we have seen the rise of digital “sharing economy”
                     platforms that enable consumers to purchase many household and personal services more
                     conveniently and cheaply, including meals ordered online and delivered by hand, thereby

                          This modeling does not include an estimate of other issues related to climate change that could cause
                          potential for incremental labor demand, such as reconstruction and carbon capture and storage.

                            increasing demand. Academic research has found that such platforms result in an increase
                            in employment in the industry, both for traditional workers providing those services and for
                            the newly self-employed workers on the platform.87 The marketization of previously unpaid
                            housework is already prevalent in some advanced economies, especially in urban areas.
                            For example, more than 90 percent of three-year-olds are enrolled in preschools in France
                            and Sweden, most of which are funded by the government. In comparison, the rate is about
                            70 percent in the United States and less than 15 percent in India.88

Women account               Shifting unpaid housework and childcare to paid employment could boost the number of
for half of the global      women in the workforce globally, if governments decided to invest in these areas (such as by
working-age                 providing universal preschool and paid family leave). Women currently account for half of the
population but              world’s working-age population but generate only 37 percent of global GDP, and in some
                            regions of the world—including India, other parts of South Asia, the Middle East and North
generate only

37%
                            Africa—their contribution to regional output is considerably lower still. At the same time,
                            about 75 percent of the world’s total unpaid care is undertaken by women, including the vital
                            tasks that keep households functioning, such as childcare, caring for the elderly, cooking,
of GDP                      and cleaning. This unpaid work amounts to as much as $10 trillion of output per year,
                            roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.89 In our analysis, we observe the average
                            amount of unpaid time currently spent on childcare, adult care, cooking, and cleaning
                            using time use surveys. As these unpaid activity hours move to the marketplace, we expect
                            labor demand to increase for them. While productivity gains will reduce the net number of
                            hours worked, we estimate that between 51 million and 89 million incremental jobs globally
                            could be created from this step-up scenario of shifting currently unpaid domestic work to
                            paid employment.

                            JOBS OF THE FUTURE: IMPACT OF NEW LABOR DEMAND VS. AUTOMATION
                            The seven trends we selected for our analysis provide us with indications about types of
                            occupations that will be in demand to 2030, even net of automation of activities within those
                            occupations. At the same time, our automation modeling highlights occupations that could
                            decline, if the current activities within those occupations that are automated are not replaced
                            by other activities. The patterns differ among countries. One of the key differentiating factors
                            is wage rates, since our model assumes that automation adoption will generally be more
                            rapid in countries such as Germany and Japan, with relatively higher wages, than in India,
                            China, or Mexico, where wages are lower. But there are also differences among emerging
                            economies depending on whether populations are aging and the occupation mix across
                            sectors, among other factors.

                            Exhibit 15 shows the top five occupations that will grow in the United States based on
                            each of the seven trends described above before accounting for displacement due to
                            automation. These are primarily direct additions, for example registered nurses related
                            to aging, or construction laborers and carpenters from the building out of infrastructure.
                            But the list also includes indirect additions, such as accountants, customer service
                            representatives, and lawyers, who will see greater demand as support functions within the
                            health-care industry feel a boost from increased spending due to aging.

                            Advanced economies have a similar pattern of job growth and declines
                            In advanced economies, we identify six broad groups of occupations that will experience
                            growth in labor demand from our trends, although the size of the increase will depend on
                            country and on scenario. For example, in our step-up scenario, the demand for builders and
                            construction workers rises considerably (Exhibit 16). Workers in occupations in the following
                            groups spend considerable time on work activities that are among the least susceptible to
                            automation based on our analysis, as they require human capabilities including social and
                            emotional interaction, higher-level logical reasoning, creativity, and application of expertise
                            that machines for now are less capable of accomplishing. The occupational groups that
                            generally grow as a result of our drivers, even net of automation, are:

                             Care providers: that is, doctors, nurses, home health aides and others in caring
                               occupations who will be in greater demand as a result of rising health-care spending,
                               both from increased prosperity and from aging. Given the disproportionate cost of health
                               care for the elderly, aging is expected to be the predominant driver of increased health-
                               care employment. Countries with aging populations such as Japan and China will see
                               a sharp increase in occupations that work closely with seniors, for example nurses,
                               nursing assistants, personal care aides, and home health aides.

                             Professionals, defined as white-collar occupations that require academic training and
                               expertise in a specific industry or functional area. These include accountants, engineers,
                               and scientists. Most of these occupations cut across a wide range of sectors. While
                               generally less automatable than other job types, certain supporting occupations such as
                               paralegals and scientific technicians may face high automation.

                             Technology professionals. Technology experts will be in continued demand
                               everywhere as automation is increasingly adopted, although the total numbers remain
                               quite small compared with other occupations. Occupations will include IT workers
                               such as computer scientists and software developers, who typically have college
                               educations, but also occupations such as web developers and electronics technicians,
                               which only require a secondary education. That said, many of these latter occupations
                               involve activities that are more automatable than technology workers with higher levels
                               of education.

                             Builders. In this category we have included architects, surveyors, and cartographers,
                               as well as construction occupations and maintenance and repair workers, such as
                               construction laborers, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers. Even though construction
                               laborers primarily do physical work, their activities are mostly in unpredictable settings,
                               and hence not as highly susceptible to automation by 2030.

                             Managers and executives also cut across all sectors and cannot easily be replaced by
                               machines, as much of their work involves interacting with and managing stakeholders.
                               However some of their more routine activities will be automated, such as collecting
                               information, analyzing data, or preparing reports.

                             Educators. School teachers and others will see a significant increase in demand,
                               especially in emerging economies with young populations such as India. Childcare
                               workers and early childhood educators will also grow under our step-up scenario in
                               which more childcare is shifted to paid providers.

                             “Creatives”: Rising incomes in emerging economies will create more demand for leisure
                               and recreational activities. This in turn will create demand for artists, performers, and
                               entertainers, although the total numbers will remain relatively small.

                           By contrast, our analysis suggests that, in advanced economies, other occupations will
                           see a net decline by 2030, with more work automated than created by our seven trends,
                           assuming they do not add non-automated activities. These include:

                            Some customer interaction jobs, including hotel workers, travel agents, entertainment
                              attendants, and cafeteria workers.

                            Office support jobs, including information clerks, payroll processors, and
                              administrative assistants.

                            Jobs carried out in predictable settings. These are among the most susceptible
                              to automation and include factory workers, material moving machine operators,
                              transportation workers, and installation and repair workers.

                           It is important to note that even occupations that may have a net decline due to automation
                           will not disappear: rather, their numbers could shrink from today’s levels in the next 15 years.
                           For instance, even though some of the current activities of food preparation and serving
                           workers could be automated (for example, by ordering kiosks in fast food restaurants), and
                           about one-fifth of their hours worked could be automated under our midpoint adoption
                           scenario, there could still be demand in the United States for more than three million of them.

                           Developing countries see net job growth in nearly all occupational groups
                           The picture is rather different in rapidly growing and low-income countries such as India,
                           where we see net job growth in nearly every occupational category. This is for two reasons:
                           low wages mean delayed adoption of automation, and relatively high GDP growth creates
                           jobs across the economy, including in predictable environments that are among the most
                           affected in advanced economies. For example, production workers would rise 34 percent in
                           India under our step-up scenario, compared with a 28 percent decline in the United States
                           and a 56 percent drop in Japan.



34%
                           Middle-income countries such as China and Mexico also have net job growth in a range
                           of occupations under our scenarios that in advanced economies experience declines.
                           This is the case with the category of workers who are primarily engaged in customer

                           result of rising consumption from an increasingly prosperous consuming class. However, in
under our                  Mexico, the potential growth is not as large as in India, reflecting the lower GDP growth and
step-up scenario           higher wages.

                           WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE?
                           The public debate in many countries over automation can quickly focus on the existential
                           question of whether there will be enough jobs for workers in a future marked by automation.
                           We can see from history that such fears have so far been unfounded: over time, labor
                           markets have adjusted to changes in demand for workers from technological disruptions,
                           although in some eras real wages have remained depressed for some time. We address
                           this question of whether there will be enough work in the future through two different but
                           complementary sets of analyses. The first is based on our model of new and additional labor
                           demand and automation described above, using the select trends we have identified, and
                           provides only a partial view. For the other analysis, we used a macroeconomic model of the
                           economy that incorporates the dynamic interactions among various factors.

                            Both analyses point in the direction that, in most scenarios, there can be enough new job
                            creation to offset the impact of automation. But a larger challenge will be ensuring that
                            workers have the skills and support needed to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail to
                            enable and smooth these transitions could see rising unemployment and depressed wages.

                            Outcomes will vary significantly by country, depending on four factors
                            We find a significant difference of likely outcomes among countries, with four factors largely
                            influencing the extent to which enough new jobs will be created to offset those displaced by
                            automation. The four factors are:

                             Wage levels. Advanced economies will likely adopt automation in the workplace earlier
                               and faster than emerging economies since their wages are relatively higher, making the
                               business case for automation stronger. (Our model assumes that automation begins to
                               be adopted only when its cost reaches parity with the cost of human labor). Advanced
                               economies will therefore likely see the largest impact from automation in the next
                               15 years.

                             Demand growth. Economic growth is essential for job creation. While it may sound
                               obvious, economies that are stagnant or growing only slowly create few, if any, net new
                               jobs. Countries with the most rapid GDP growth rate per capita will have higher growth
                               rates of consumption and spending, thus stimulating greater proportional increases in
                               labor demand. Slower-growing economies will create jobs at a slower rate. Advanced
                               economies have much lower projected rates of GDP growth than developing countries,
                               reflecting aging workforces and also less rapid productivity growth. Developing countries
                               such as India and China are projected to have much higher GDP per capita growth rates,
                               which will contribute to job creation. Furthermore, innovation and entrepreneurship often
                               underlie the creation of new business models and work activities, another catalyst of
                               job growth.

                             Demographics. The outcome of automation and future labor demand will play out
                               very differently in countries with a young and rapidly-growing population, such as India,
                               compared with countries that have a shrinking population and workforce, such as
                               Japan. Countries with a growing workforce have a potential “demographic dividend” that
                               will lift growth. However, rapid growth of the population will bring millions more young
                               people into the workforce, creating considerable pressure to expand formal employment
                               opportunities. While the impact of automation will be less, given lower wage rates in
                               these countries, automation will make this already considerable challenge more difficult.
                               In Germany and Japan, by comparison, aging is reducing the working-age population,
                               which reduces the need for economic growth and the potential impact of automation.

                             Mix of economic sectors. The automation potential of national economies differs
                               among countries depending on the structure of their economies and, within the
                               economy as a whole, on the mix of sectors, occupations, and their constituent work
                               activities. Japan, for example, has a higher automation potential than the United
                               States because the weight of certain sectors that are highly automatable, such as
                               manufacturing, is higher in Japan; 17 percent of jobs in Japan are in the manufacturing
                               sector compared with 9 percent in the United States. And within the manufacturing
                               sector itself, Japan is more susceptible to automation because a larger proportion of the
                               jobs involve tasks that can be more easily automated, such as production.

                     These factors combine to create different outlooks for the future of work in each country. In
                     general, countries with similar characteristics across these four factors could see broadly
                     similar outcomes from automation adoption, albeit with nuances for cultural and other
                     differences. Some clusters are apparent. For example, developed countries with aging
                     populations and high wages that will accelerate automation adoption—such as Germany,
                     Italy, and Japan—could follow a similar trajectory, as will developed countries with younger
                     populations, such as Canada, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
                     States. Across the Middle East, countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United
                     Arab Emirates share similarities on demographics and automation adoption and, to a lesser
                     extent, on GDP per capita. Developing countries with the youngest populations, including
                     Egypt, Kenya, and Nigeria, will face similar challenges to grow aggregate demand, given
                     their fast-growing workforce.

                     Our scenarios of new and additional labor demand, net of automation, while
                     incomplete, suggest ample job creation to 2030
                     We compare the number of jobs created by the seven selected trends identified above with
                     the number of jobs expected to be displaced by automation. We are conscious that this
                     exercise paints an incomplete picture. While our seven trends model the major sources of
                     new labor demand, they do not account for induced job demand creation nor the creation
                     of novel work activities and occupations. One research study has found that, each year,
                     roughly 0.5 percent of the US labor force is employed in an occupation that did not exist
                     in the prior year—in other words, performing an entirely new set or combination of work
                     activities. By 2030, this would imply that 9 percent of the US labor force could be employed
                     in occupations that do not exist today.90 Just as many occupations today, such as search
                     engine optimization, app designers, and website designers, would have been impossible
                     to imagine in the pre-Internet era, we cannot foresee the new occupations that will arise in
                     the future.

                     In order to address the question, “Will there be enough work in the future?,” we compare the
                     net effects of jobs displaced by automation, jobs created by the seven trends, the creation
                     of new work and other unsized labor demand, and demographic changes in labor force
                     size. Even limiting our estimates of new and additional job creation to the select factors
                     that we model, we find that our focus countries could generate enough labor demand to
                     offset the impact of automation and take into account changes in the size of labor forces.91
                     Nevertheless, our modeling from the seven trends indicates that the transition toward 2030
                     looks quite different depending on the country (see Exhibit 17).

                     For instance, Japan is rich but projected to grow slowly to 2030. It faces the combination of
                     slower job creation coming from economic expansion and a large share of work that can be
                     automated as a result of high wages and the structure of its economy. However, Japan will
                     also see its workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people. In the step-up scenario, and
                     considering the jobs in new occupations we cannot envision today, Japan’s net change in
                     jobs could be roughly in balance.

                          Our results are broadly in line with prior research by McKinsey & Company in nine northern European digital
                          “front-runner” countries. This research suggests that technology diffusion contributed 0.4 to 0.6 percentage
                          points, or around 30 percent, to GDP growth between 1990 and 2016 in the nine countries. Digital technology
                          replaced jobs at a rate of about 120,000 jobs a year between 1999 and 2010, and boosted employment by
                          around 200,000 jobs a year, creating positive net employment of 80,000 jobs per year. More than half of the
                          new jobs were high-skill. Shaping the future of work in Europe’s digital front-runners, McKinsey & Company,

1 Historical analysis suggests that we could expect 8–9% of 2030 labor supply will be in “new jobs,” which is additional to labor demand we have estimated.
NOTE: We identified seven catalysts of labor demand globally: rising incomes, health-care spending, investment in technology, buildings, infrastructure, and
  energy, and the marketization of unpaid work. We compared the number of jobs to be replaced by automation with the number of jobs created by our seven
  catalysts as well as change in labor force, between 2016 and 2030. Some occupational data projected into 2016 baseline from latest available 2014 data. Not

                     Like Japan, the United States and Germany also face significant workforce displacement
                     from automation by 2030, but their projected future growth—and hence new job creation—
                     is higher. However, the United States has a growing workforce. In the step-up scenario, and
                     considering new occupations that may arise, it is roughly in balance. Germany’s workforce
                     will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor demand to
                     employ all workers.

                     At the other extreme is India: a fast-growing developing country with relatively modest
                     potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflecting low wage rates. Our analysis
                     finds that most occupational categories are projected to grow in India, reflecting its strong
                     economic expansion. However, India’s labor force is expected to grow by 138 million
                     people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrants in formal sector jobs
                     will require job creation on a much larger scale than in the past. Automation will make
                     this challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth” will make the challenge greater.
                     However, our analysis suggests that India can create enough new jobs to offset automation
                     and employ new entrants, for example by undertaking the investments in our step-
                     up scenario.

                     China and Mexico have higher wages than India, and so are likely to see more automation.
                     China still enjoys robust economic growth and will have a shrinking workforce; like Germany,
                     China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Given net job creation as well as declining
                     labor forces, China and Germany may need to explore different options such as accelerating
                     automation adoption or immigration in order to fulfill the expected creation of growing future
                     labor demand. Mexico’s rate of future economic expansion is more modest than China’s,
                     and its workforce will grow by 15 million by 2030. Like the United States and Japan, our
                     results suggest that Mexico may need the extra job creation from the step-up scenario plus
                     innovation in new occupations to make full use of its workforce.

                     Our macroeconomic modeling highlights the critical importance of rapid
                     reemployment of workers displaced by automation
                     The analysis of net job creation given expected automation rates and the seven trends is an
                     informative but incomplete exercise, even after adjusting for labor supply changes and the
                     creation of new occupations. This is because the analysis above does not take into account
                     dynamic interaction among the trends, such as the impact of automation investment and
                     automation-related unemployment on GDP growth rates or economy-wide average wage
                     rates. Thus, to develop a perspective on the potential net impact of automation and job
                     creation potential of the economy, we use a general equilibrium model in order to triangulate
                     our results with the analysis from the seven trends (see Box 4, “Modeling the economic
                     impact of automation”).

                     The overall result of the general equilibrium model is the same as the result from the seven
                     trends: it shows that labor markets will generally be flexible enough to absorb the workers
                     displaced by automation. Furthermore, like the outcome of the analysis from the seven
                     trends, differences arise between countries in the expected transition toward 2030. The
                     general equilibrium model points toward a strong distinction in the expected transition
                     between the advanced economies and the emerging economies we focus on in this report.

                            Box 4. Modeling the economic impact of automation
                            We used McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model to model the dynamic impacts
                            of automation on the economies of our six focus countries.1 This is a supply-side general
                            equilibrium macroeconomic model that covers more than 100 countries with data from
                            1960 through 2015.

                            In the model, we directly included three factors by which automation affects economic
                            growth: labor displacement, resulting in workers losing their jobs; capital investment needed
                            to implement the automation technologies; and an increase in productivity growth, as firms
                            employ more capital per worker. These inputs to the Global Growth Model are derived
                            from our automation research. To calculate the impact on productivity, we estimate the
                            implied productivity growth that would be needed to maintain constant total output with
                            fewer workers, under the rationale that firms would not adopt the new technology unless it
                            produced at least the same level of output. In reality, this is likely to be an underestimate of
                            the impact. Our experience working with firms and our prior automation research shows
                            that automation often results in higher quality output and significantly higher level of output
                            as well.

                            We also model how quickly displaced workers are employed in new jobs, or the
                            reemployment rate. Not every displaced worker will enter unemployment; some will have the
                            skills and the opportunity to transition quickly into a new role at the same company or with a
                            new firm. Indeed, each year millions of US workers leave a job and find a new one. Between
                            2013 and 2015, 66 percent of displaced workers in the United States found a new job by
                            the end of the period; 49 percent of workers displaced between 2007 and 2009, during the
                            financial crisis, were reemployed by the beginning of 2010.

                            We model four reemployment rate scenarios—low, medium, high, and full reemployment.
                            The reemployment rates modeled differ by country and are estimated from literature and
                            adjusted for labor market flexibility factors.

                            1
                                The structure of the model is anchored in the academic literature on economic growth models. For details see
                                Shifting tides: Global economic scenarios for 2015–25, McKinsey & Company, September 2015.




                            In advanced economies, all scenarios result in full employment by 2030, but the
                            transition may include a period of higher unemployment and wage adjustments
                            For the three advanced economies we focus on in this report—Germany, Japan, and
                            the United States—economies are flexible enough to absorb most if not all the displaced
                            workers by 2030 in all reemployment scenarios. The pace at which displaced workers are
                            reemployed is critical: lower reemployment leads to higher medium-term unemployment,
                            while in the highest reemployment scenario, the labor displaced by automation will be
                            reemployed fast enough such that the unemployment rate does not rise (Exhibit 18).

                            Automation will also have a wage impact. Our modeling results in a temporary increase
                            in wages in all reemployment scenarios because of increased productivity as a result of
                            automation. But, as with the unemployment rate, wages will also depend on the pace of
                            reemployment. In the lower reemployment scenarios, wages fall in the long-run in response
                            to high medium-term unemployment. This leads to a lower labor share of income, as
                            the gains of automation in this scenario primarily accrue to capital owners, not laborers.
                            Conversely, in the highest reemployment scenario, wage growth is expected to persist,
                            and thus the decades-long trend of declining labor share of income slows or even reverses
                            by 2040.

                                  In emerging economies, automation’s impact on employment is smaller than in
                                  advanced economies
                                  The impact of automation is lesser in China, India, and Mexico than in the advanced
                                  economies we focus on, according to our simulation. First, automation rates are expected
                                  to be lower, leading to smaller percentages of displaced workers, lower levels of capital
                                  investment, and smaller productivity increases. As such, unemployment is not expected to
                                  rise significantly, nor are modeled wages or GDP growth sensitive to the automation effect
                                  under any of the reemployment scenarios.

                                  Automation will displace jobs around the world by 2030, but in our analysis demand for
                                  certain types of labor—from care providers to builders—will also increase, spurred by the
                                  rising consumer class in emerging economies and the growing health-care needs of aging
                                  populations in nations from Germany and Italy to China and Japan, among other trends. Our
                                  dynamic modeling of the US and other economies suggests that enough new jobs will be
                                  created to return to full employment by 2030, but the transition could be difficult. Depending
                                  on the rate at which displaced workers are reemployed, the unemployment rate could rise in
                                  the short- to medium-term, and wages may fall thereafter. Moreover, our analysis highlights
                                  differences between the sorts of jobs that will be lost from automation, and those that will be
                                  gained from a range of trends. Even if there is enough work to go around in 2030, millions
                                  of individuals may need to find new jobs and possibly acquire new skills. We examine these
                                  trends in the next chapter.

                     4. IMPLICATIONS FOR SKILLS
                     AND WAGES
                     The combination of labor displacement by automation and changing demand for
                     occupations that we have outlined in the previous chapters will have enormous implications
                     for individual workers. We estimate that 60 million to 375 million individuals around the world
                     may need to transition to new occupational categories by 2030 , in the event of midpoint or
                     early automation adoption (although that number would be negligible in 2030 in our edge-
                     case slow automation adoption scenario). Nearly all jobs will involve a shifting mix of tasks
                     and activities.

                     Within occupations, the mix of activities and the capabilities required will skew toward
                     more personal interactions and more advanced levels of cognitive capabilities. Educational
                     requirements will also change: net of automation, a greater share of jobs in the future will
                     likely require higher levels of educational attainment. In advanced economies, that includes
                     increasing demand for jobs that currently require a college degree (or other advanced
                     training). At the same time, employers and workers may need to take a more fine-grained
                     approach to identify skills that are the most important.

                     Our results also suggest that income polarization in advanced economies including
                     the United States could be exacerbated.92 We do not dynamically model how wages
                     might change for individual occupations by 2030, but based on current wages, we find
                     that in most advanced countries, middle-wage jobs may decline the most as a result of
                     automation. Growing occupations in these countries will tend to be either those that are less
                     remunerative, for example, retail salespeople or childcare workers, or quite the opposite:
                     highly paid jobs, such as software engineers. In developing economies including China,
                     however, we see the opposite trend. Here the strongest job growth will likely be for middle-
                     wage occupations, including service and construction jobs.

                     THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN OCCUPATIONS WILL CHANGE
Up to                For nearly all occupations, automation will change the mix of activities that humans perform,


375M
                     as some tasks are taken over by machines or software. Over time, occupational definitions
                     may change, as the boundaries between different occupations become blurred. Already,
                     physician assistants and registered nurses carry out many tasks that doctors used to do,
workers globally
                     such as handling routine cases or giving shots. For their part, doctors now write up memos
may need to          and enter data rather than dictating to assistants.
transition to new
occupational         With automation, such shifts may become more pronounced, although the specifics will
categories by 2030   vary by country. In Germany, workers of the future will likely spend more time on activities
                     that require applying expertise (+2.9 billion full-time equivalent hours), interacting with
                     stakeholders (+1.5 billion hours), and managing people (+1.4 billion hours), and less time
                     on predictable physical activities (-2.6 billion hours), collecting data (-2.5 billion hours) and
                     processing data (-2.1 billion hours), where machines already exceed human performance
                     (Exhibit 19). In other words, many of the rote activities that have dominated the workplace
                     in the post-industrial age will be taken over by machines. Work activity will shift to human
                     interaction and working in unpredictable environments—and will also require increasing
                     application of expertise. Similar shifts will occur in other high-wage, advanced economies.

                                    In India, much of the projected growth in activity hours will be in physical activities, driven
                                                                                                                   Displaced

                                    has higher levels of existing infrastructure and building development, will still see some
                                    growth in physical activities. However, most of the growth will be in activities similar to its
                                    advanced-economy counterparts, such as interacting with stakeholders and applying
                                                                                                                   Displaced

                                    This shifting set of activities has implications for the capabilities that will be needed for
                                    future work. Exhibit 20 shows how US workers will need to upgrade their mastery   Net    of the 18
                                    performance capabilities we used for our automation modeling.

                                    More work activities will require social and emotional skills and advanced cognitive
                                    capabilities, such as high-level logical reasoning—capabilities that are required today for
                                    only a relatively limited number of jobs. This will be a challenge for education, training, and
                                    skill assessment models, which for now do not always emphasize “soft skills” such as social
                                    and emotional reasoning and sensing.

                                  Additional jobs will often require a higher level of performance across many capabilities. For
                                  instance, machines will be able to perform work activities requiring basic levels of retrieving
                                  information and understanding natural language—but jobs requiring higher levels of these
                                  capabilities will grow. In advanced economies, physical capabilities will be less in demand
                                  as a percentage of the activity hours demanded in the economy. In developing economies
                                  such as India, given the increase in demand for physical activities, demand for physical
                                  capabilities will accordingly grow as a percentage of the new activity hours demanded.
                                  The shift in activities and underlying capabilities required will touch almost all jobs in the
                                  economy, to varying degrees—but especially in advanced economies. As one example, the
                                  work of retail salespeople in these economies could change significantly; about 20 percent
                                  of their current work activities could be automated in the midpoint scenario. The rote
                                  aspects of the job such as processing transactions and gathering product information may
                                  be automated. Retail workers instead may turn their attention to the more people-focused
                                  side of the job: greeting customers and answering questions, for example, or suggesting
                                  new products.

                                  The capability shift is not limited to front-line jobs. Many workers in occupations with high
                                  educational requirements who spend much of their time collecting and processing data
                                  could experience a significant shift in their work activities. Financial managers, for example,
                                  could spend less time monitoring cashflow or approving expenditures, and instead
                                  have time to focus on more managerial functions such as supervising employees and
                                  advising others on business matters. Professionals of all stripes are quickly realizing the
                                  growing importance of “soft skills”—although understanding the implications of numerical
                                  calculations will continue to be important. On LinkedIn, the professional networking site, for
                                  example, professionals are increasingly developing and marketing themselves around these
                                  softer skills, which are less automatable (Exhibit 21).93

                            This changing nature of activities and capabilities has important implications for the
                            requirements and aims of job training, which will be particularly relevant in times of transition.
                            For example, as activities requiring basic levels of performance are automated in the United
                            States, training efforts will need to focus on capabilities for which automation is more
                            challenging, such as social and emotional capabilities. Increasingly across occupations,
                            workers will be valued for strong interpersonal skills and advanced reasoning. As these
                            skills are often developed through guided experience, workers will likely spend more time
                            being coached in apprentice-like environments. The workers of the future will still need to
                            apply expertise and judgment, so training to promote fluency with and understanding of
                            information will remain important.

                            GROWING JOB CATEGORIES HAVE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
                            THAN THE WORK DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION
                            Across our six focus countries, a greater share of jobs in the future—accounting for both the
                            effects from automation and the additional labor demand from the seven trends—are likely
                            to demand increased levels of education (Exhibit 22).94

                            Defining and measuring the skills required to perform well in any job is a difficult and
                            imprecise task. In our modeling, we look at several different measures of workforce skills.
                            First, we consider the formal educational requirements of each occupation: secondary
                            school degree, Associate’s, Bachelor’s, and graduate degrees. Educational requirements
                            by occupation are fairly well standardized globally and allow for cross-country comparisons.
                            However, even within an occupation, there will be a range of degrees that existing workers
                            have obtained; we focus on the educational levels that are typically required.95 We also look
                            at how activities within occupations will change, which gives some indication of the types
                            of skills that will be more or less in demand, and we consider the capabilities required to
                            perform those activities—such as cognitive skills, creativity, social and emotional skills.
                            Other definitions of skills and credentials are equally valid and important, but are beyond
                            the scope of this report. Many practitioners and researchers today focus on unbundling
                            traditional degrees into well-defined credentials that can be obtained by demonstrating
                            mastery of specific skills. This is particularly attractive for midcareer workers who cannot
                            afford to spend years earning a traditional degree, or who have accumulated valuable
                            experience on the job. Some credentials are for quite narrow skills: programming in a certain
                            computer language, or mastering one specific type of mechanical expertise.96




                            94
                                 We do not model changing skill requirements for occupations, and assume that educational requirements for
                                 an occupation in all countries are the same as in the United States. See technical appendix for details.
                            95
                                 Economists note the general trend of “degree inflation.” For instance, in the United States, while 80 percent of
                                 job openings for executive assistants list a bachelor’s degree as a requirement, fewer than half of existing EAs
                                 have that degree. See Peter Capelli, Will college pay off? A guide to the most important financial decision you’ll
                                 ever make, PublicAffairs, 2015.

                                    In advanced economies, demand for work currently requiring completion of
                                    secondary school or less will likely decline
                                    In advanced economies, our model shows a common pattern of educational requirements.
                                    Occupations that currently require only completion of secondary school or less, including
                                    jobs such as office clerks, hand packers and packagers, and tellers, are most likely to be
                                    affected by automation and have a net reduction in labor demand, based on the factors we
                                    have modeled (Exhibit 23).

                                    Not all jobs in these categories will disappear, but in 2030, demand for the activities they
                                    currently perform will be lower in all of our modeled scenarios. In contrast, occupations
                                    requiring a college or graduate degree will see the most growth as a percentage of jobs
                                    in the economy. Occupations that require training on top of a traditional post-secondary
                                    degree (for example, career, technical, vocational training) or two-year associates’ degree

                     have a mixed outlook. As a share of jobs in the economies, countries such as Japan will
                     see increased demand for associates’ and equivalent degrees, primarily from middle-skill
                     health-care occupations such as nurses and paramedics. Meanwhile, countries such as
                     Germany will see decreased demand, primarily because of a greater share of automatable
                     office support jobs such as clerks and secretaries.

                     The relative growth of jobs requiring higher educational attainment is not a new
                     observation.97 Nor is the increase of skill requirements necessarily a break from historical
                     trend: the manufacturing revolution saw increased need for literacy training that spawned
                     movements toward secondary education including the High School Movement in the United
                     States, which we discuss in the next chapter.

                     However, many of the middle-income jobs of the past that required only a secondary
                     education or less, and minimal training, will likely face significant displacement in an
                     automated world. These jobs include heavy truck drivers and office clerks, both of which
                     have high technical potential for automation over our modeled time horizon, and whose
                     current middle-level wages raise the economic incentives to deploy automation. Many
                     additional jobs requiring low and middle levels of educational attainment could be created,
                     driven particularly by the caring economy, such as the rise of nurses and nursing assistants.
                     However, for many jobs that require no or only secondary education, the additional future
                     labor demand will not fully make up for the jobs displaced by automation. This would mean
                     that many displaced workers would need to retrain and/or raise their educational levels to
                     gain employment in one of the in-demand occupations.

                     The seven trends we modeled alone suggest that overall new demand for work currently
                     requiring a college degree could be sufficient to balance the reduction in demand
                     for work activities lost to automation in occupations requiring college completion, in
                     the United States, as well as in Germany (where the net modeled demand for these
                     occupations increases).

                     However, that does not obviate the need for college and advanced degree holders to
                     retrain, as their activities will change. Some will switch to jobs that require a similar level
                     of educational attainment, but very different skills. The coming wave of technology
                     deployment, bolstered by advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, has
                     significant potential to automate work activities previously thought to be the exclusive
                     domain of highly-trained humans. In the midpoint automation scenario, 13 percent of the
                     current work activities performed in occupations that require college or advanced degrees
                     in the United States could be displaced. Even within a given field, certain occupations will
                     fare better than others. In the United States, for example, the high-skill job of application
                     software developer has large net additional demand (we model nearly ten times as many
                     jobs created as displaced). Meanwhile certain technology support jobs including computer
                     systems administrators and support specialists may see a cooling of demand, because
                     a substantial portion of their current activities have relatively high technical automation
                     potential. Similarly, in US financial services, the varied skills required of management
                     analysts could see high demand, while financial managers and securities sales agents
                     could face substantial automation of their current work activities with limited sources of
                     new demand.

                          For example, MIT economist David Autor has credited the trend to productivity boosts from information
                          technology that magnifies the productive power of cognitive functions, which is often central to higher-skill
                          work. Ibid. David H. Autor, “Why are there still so many jobs?” summer 2015. In the United States, about two-
                          thirds of jobs from Baby Boom retirement require more than a secondary school education. Jamie Merisotis,

                            Workers displaced by automation may need to invest time to acquire new skills, either
                            through formal education or other training programs. Conversely, jobs themselves may
                            need to be redesigned to accommodate an influx of new workers with less sector-specific
                            training and overall education. The transitions could be varied and lead to friction in the
                            labor market and potentially higher unemployment in the short-run. But other steps could
                            be taken to make markets function better. For example, defining job requirements, as well
                            as providing training and certification, based on specific skills, could improve the matching
                            of labor supply and demand, as these skills can be much more fine-grained than traditional
                            educational degrees, and can often be acquired in less time than finishing a multi-year
                            degree program.

                            While some workers who are displaced by automation will be able to find a job in a similar
                            function and with similar educational requirements (for example, a displaced cashier finding
                            a new job as a retail salesperson), many will not, and will need to gain additional skills, which
                            may or may not actually raise their educational level. This is discussed in a subsequent
                            section of this chapter.

                            Additional job creation in our step-up scenario could help mitigate some of the impact of
                            automation, with additional investment in infrastructure, buildings, and energy transitions
                            potentially creating new work for workers with low and mid-level educational attainment. In
                            all, in the United States, we estimate additional demand for mid-skill labor of up to 1 million
                            jobs, net of automation, in the step-up scenario. Demand for occupations requiring post-
                            secondary education also increases in the step-up scenario. Engineers and cost estimators
                            will be brought in to develop infrastructure projects, for example, and various professionals,
                            from accountants to research analysts, will also see increased demand.

                            In developing countries, the largest number of new jobs will be those requiring
                            secondary education or technical skills
                            In emerging economies, the rate of job growth is highest for occupations that require a
                            college degree or more, but the absolute amount of job growth is highest for occupations
                            with a secondary education diploma.

                            In China, for instance, occupations currently requiring college and advanced degrees will
                            see increased demand—in the case of those with college degrees, this could be as high
                            as 22 million additional net jobs under our step-up scenario. However, the largest absolute
                            number of jobs created—almost 60 million in the step-up scenario—currently require only
                            a secondary school diploma, with significant increased demand for retail salespeople,
                            nursing assistants, childcare workers and others according to our analysis. Despite the
                            dual threat of automation (particularly for manufacturing, which makes up about 19 percent
                            of employment in China) and other increasing productivity, significant demand will be
                            created for lower-skill work, primarily due to rising prosperity. Also, jobs with low educational
                            attainment requirements in these countries are generally lower wage, and are thus less
                            economically attractive to automate.

                            India, meanwhile, will see the largest new demand net of automation for workers with a
                            secondary education. According to our analysis, as many as 100 million new jobs could
                            be created for Indians with secondary education—even after accounting for the effect of
                            automation—as rising prosperity will create a surge of new labor demand for construction,
                            retail, and health care and education jobs, among others. The largest countries in the
                            developing world, in short, should not have a shortage of labor demand across any

                                    TENS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY WILL NEED TO SWITCH
                                    OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES, AND MAY REQUIRE TRAINING TO DO SO
                                    Our findings shed some light on the potential size of the worker transitions that will be
                                    necessary in the years to 2030—and the immense training efforts that will be necessary
                                    as the nature of some work changes. We estimate that up to 75 million workers may have
                                    to switch occupational categories and/or educational levels in the midpoint automation
                                    scenario (Exhibit 24).99 If automation technologies are developed and adopted sooner,
                                    those numbers grow rapidly; in the earliest automation adoption scenarios that we analyze,
                                    as many as 375 million people may need to change occupational categories and/or
                                    educational levels. However, our step-up scenarios reduce our estimates of the number
                                    of people needing to make these types of transitions, with additional labor demand trends
                                    offsetting more job displacement from automation within occupational categories. Not
                                    shown on the exhibit, in the slowest automation scenario, the number of required transitions
                                    is significantly reduced (almost negligible in most countries).

                            Some of these people who are displaced will seek new education and many will need new
                            skills. People will also need to learn new skills within their occupations as activities change,
                            particularly where those activities are augmented by automation. As a point of calibration,
                            in our rising incomes trend, we project that between 190 million and 205 million students
                            will be in tertiary education in 2030.100 In the fastest automation scenario that we model,
                            the number of people that will need to transition between 2016 and 2030 is almost double
                            that number.

                            These transitions could surface frictions in the labor market, for reasons ranging from lower
                            wages to cultural and gender bias, but also present new opportunities for work and job
                            growth. For example, men could find opportunities to retrain into jobs in which women have
                            dominated in some countries, such as nursing in the United States, and vice versa.101

                            WAGE POLARIZATION MAY CONTINUE IN SOME ADVANCED ECONOMIES
                            Middle-wage jobs have felt the impact of automation in the past decades in the United
                            States, creating a polarization phenomenon. Modeling the potential impact of automation,
                            we find that this polarization could continue and become exacerbated in advanced
                            economies—but not universally. Indeed, one of our findings is that the potential wage impact
                            of automation and future labor demand could vary considerably among countries. We also
                            find that any polarization of wages is not due solely to skill gaps; some of the additional
                            demand for middle-skill jobs are in those that are currently paid low wages in countries such
                            as the United States.

                            In advanced economies, high-wage occupations see the most growth net
                            of automation
                            Academic literature examining the recent impact of technology on wages has found that
                            a distinct pattern of “hollowing” or a decline in middle-skill and middle-wage jobs with
                            growth in high- and low-wage occupations (see Box 5, “Our prior research on income and
                            equality trends”).102

                            Our analysis is based on current average wages for each occupation in each country.
                            Modeling wages over time by occupation based on the dynamics of labor supply and
                            demand is outside the scope of this study, beyond the top-down analysis of wage impact
                            that we described in the previous chapter. Nonetheless, our examination of job growth at
                            different current wage levels offers some indications of what the future may hold.

                            In the United States and Germany, in our trendline labor demand and midpoint automation
                            scenarios, occupations in the top 30 percent of average current wages experience net job
                            growth by 2030 (Exhibit 25). This holds for the United States even in the modeled step-
                            up scenario; in the step-up scenario for Germany, rising need for jobs such as nursing
                            assistants is expected to increase demand for middle-wage jobs. The largest declines are in
                            jobs in the middle of the wage distribution. Occupations in the lowest 30 percent of wages
                            decline, but this reflects the net impact of modest growth in low-wage occupations such
                            as retail salespeople, and declining occupations such as hand packers/packagers and
                            cafeteria cooks.

                                  Our analysis suggests that future labor demand on an aggregate basis will not have a gender bias. Automation
                                  overall will affect jobs that are traditionally male-dominated, as in manufacturing, but also jobs that are
                                  traditionally female-dominated, such as food services or accommodation. New jobs with a traditional male
                                  bias such as construction work will be created, as will jobs such as nurses that have traditionally been
                                  dominated by women.

                                   In the United States, the pattern of polarization is clearer if we look at the net job growth by
                                   wage decile (Exhibit 26). The top two deciles experience significant new demand for labor
                                   net of automation, primarily driven by an increase in demand for high-skill professionals,
                                   including technology and medical professionals. The effects of aging and, in the step-up
                                   scenario, professionalization of unpaid work also create growth at the lower end of the
                                   wage spectrum, around the 20th percentile. This is driven by growth in nursing assistants,
                                   teaching assistants, and personal care aides, among others.

                                   In our model, the step-up scenario involving increased spending on such areas as
                                   infrastructure, real estate, and energy transitions can help create more growth in middle-
                                   wage (as well as low-wage) jobs. For example, in the United States, increased infrastructure
                                   and real estate spending can create additional demand for labor in construction, skilled
                                   craftspeople, and technical production jobs, which are middle-wage jobs. The increased
                                   professionalization of unpaid services would also add jobs for middle-wage work in
                                   countries like Germany through increased demand for nursing assistants and childcare
                                   workers. These types of jobs could help produce some of the additional labor demand to
                                   offset activities that could be automated, in particular, providing demand for middle-wage
                                   jobs in advanced economies.

                     In developing countries, middle-wage occupations could experience
                     strong growth
                     The potential wage trend picture is quite different in emerging economies. In India,
                     occupations at all wage levels are boosted by demand from rising prosperity, while the
                     economy will largely be shielded from automation because of lower wages. In China, our
                     scenarios show that middle-wage jobs will rise similarly. Across both countries, the main
                     occupations that are driving this growth in middle-wage jobs involve customer interaction.
                     Job growth is particularly pronounced for cashiers and retail salespeople, which are
                     middle-wage jobs in these markets. While in the developed world many of these jobs may
                     be automated, in India and China, wages are low enough that automation rates will likely
                     be constrained in the 2030 timeframe (modeled at under 10 percent). The story is a positive
                     one for wage advancement and the development of the middle class: in India, for example,
                     if farmworkers (with annual salary of $1,752) find themselves out of a job because of
                     productivity improvements, many new and more highly-paid services jobs will sprout up in
                     hosting (average wage of $2,204), and for retail salespeople ($4,101).

                     In these developing countries, the challenge will be to continue to create more high-wage
                     work opportunities for high-skill workers, and move a greater proportion of workers into
                     higher wage jobs. While India will have high demand for high-wage work, this type of work
                     in China is more susceptible to automation compared with other developing countries,
                     according to our model, primarily because of higher wage rates. Computer support
                     specialists and law clerks, two high-wage occupations, have an automation potential in the
                     midpoint adoption scenario of 34 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Overall, then, while
                     developing countries may have less to worry about when it comes to creating labor demand
                     to offset the effects of automation in the near term, policy makers and business leaders may
                     want to focus on the creation of more gainful and desirable employment.103

                                                                               •••

                     Work will change in the next decade and beyond, with significant implications both for
                     skill requirements and wages. While our research suggests that these trends will play out
                     differently among countries, some commonalities are apparent. One is that educational
                     requirements and performance capabilities, including for soft skills such as social
                     and emotional reasoning, will become ever more important. In advanced economies
                     including the United States, middle-wage workers could continue to see a shrinking
                     pool of opportunities as automation outpaces new job creation. As many as 375 million
                     individuals around the world will need to switch occupational categories. Providing retraining
                     opportunities at scale will be imperative. What should the policy priorities be in this changing
                     workplace? In the following chapter, we look at how the transitions brought about by
                     automation can best be managed.

China’s shift out of agriculture into manufacturing and services is likely to continue and, as incomes continue
rising, consumption will increase. With its aging and shrinking workforce, China will benefit from embracing
automation to increase productivity and meet projected 2030 labor needs.

  what we have estimated.

Germany has an aging population and a declining working-age population. Relatively high wages make a
stronger case for early automation adoption, while medium GDP growth creates sufficient labor demand in
most scenarios. Health-care needs from aging and increased consumer spending will drive most job creation.

1 Historical analysis suggests that we could expect 8-9% of 2030 labor supply will be in “new jobs” relative to today, which is additional to
  what we have estimated.

India is expected to continue industrializing as its economy shifts away from agriculture. As GDP per capita
continues to expand amid rapid growth of the labor force, many of India’s jobs of the future will be driven by
construction and the consumption habits of the expanding middle class.

1 Historical analysis suggests that we could expect 8-9% of 2030 labor supply will be in “new jobs” relative to today, which is additional to
  what we have estimated.

Japan’s sector mix and relatively high wages will speed automation adoption, while relatively slow GDP per
capita growth could dampen labor demand. The decline in the working-age population will act as a
countervailing force, but a step-up scenario of job creation will be needed to sustain future employment.

Mexico has a young population and a growing workforce. Mid- to low-wage levels may slow automation
adoption, while comparatively low GDP growth may temper growth in labor demand. The step-up scenario will
create enough labor demand to offset the effects of both automation and demographics.

5. MANAGING THE WORKFORCE
TRANSITIONS
Brace yourself. All countries will face large-scale workforce transitions over the next 15 years
as automation displaces some workers and labor demand shifts. Enabling and smoothing
these transitions will be a significant challenge for policy makers and business leaders.
Some policy choices could substantially improve the employment outcomes, including
speeding reemployment. Indeed, it may take a Marshall Plan-scale initiative of sustained
investment by the public and private sectors in new training models and workforce transition
programs to address all the social, political, and economic issues that automation will raise.

In this chapter, we discuss four priorities that could make a critical difference: maintaining
robust economic growth to support job creation; scaling up workforce retraining and
skill development programs, particularly for midcareer workers; improving labor market
dynamism; and providing income and transition support to displaced workers. We
explore some of the choices that could be considered and cite examples of successful
interventions. These ideas should not be taken as exhaustive or prescriptive, but rather as
prompts to spur discussion and new ideas. Specific choices will vary based on country
circumstances and societal choices.

MAINTAINING ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INNOVATION TO SUPPORT
JOB CREATION
The starting point is an economic one: sustaining robust aggregate demand growth is
essential for enabling employment growth. Economies that are not expanding do not create
new jobs. Indeed, the experience of the past decade has underscored the lingering negative
employment effects of insufficient demand.

Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies can be deployed to ensure that demand
growth is vibrant, and it goes beyond the scope of this report to catalog the appropriate
macroeconomic policies. Nonetheless, the importance of sustaining demand growth
cannot be overemphasized. Much has also been written about potential ways to encourage
innovation and entrepreneurship, from investments in research and development
and human capital, to investment capital, and lowered barriers to entry for innovative
businesses.104 Supporting innovation and technological diffusion is critical, including the
adoption of automation technologies themselves, as these advances are the fundamental
source of long-run productivity, growth, and prosperity, as well as the creation of new
business models, occupations, and work activities. To do so will require an effective and
balanced system for encouraging the development and deployment of intellectual property,
a high-skill scientific and engineering workforce, and public or private funding for basic
research and its commercialization. New business creation, start-up communities, and
dynamic firm entry and exit are also essential.105 For small cities that lack a diversified
economy and where the principal employer leaves, more holistic economic revival plans
are needed.106

                      Actions can be taken not only at the national level, but also locally. MGI studies of cities
                      around the world, along with a growing body of academic research, illustrate the vast
                      differences in economic growth and prosperity that arise among cities and regions of the
                      same country.107 The last 20 years of globalization and technological change have resulted
                      in many communities in the United States and Europe suffering large-scale job losses—but
                      some of these communities have also shown that reviving growth through knowledge-
                      based economies is possible. A common pattern emerges: harnessing intellectual capital,
                      often found in universities, with private sector R&D and local governments willing to ensure
                      workforce training to meet the new demand.108

                      Many policymakers, in both advanced and developing countries such as India, worry
                      about “jobless growth.”109 Since the 2008 global financial crisis, it has become clear that
                      not all sources of GDP growth have an equal impact on employment creation. Growth in
                      industries that are heavily capital-intensive or those that are highly automated will not have
                      the same impact on job creation. To support broad-based job creation, some countries may
                      provide incentives to labor-intensive service sectors, such as health care, education, and
                      construction. Targeted initiatives may also be used. Catalyzing public and private investment
                      for infrastructure, including the housing and commercial buildings needed in urbanizing
                      countries in the developing world, not only supports long-term economic growth but also
                      has the potential to create large-scale employment in the near-term. Supporting measures
                      to shift energy to renewable sources, manage and mitigate climate change, and boost
                      energy efficiency through increased digitization of the sector likewise have global economic
                      benefits while boosting near-term employment. The step-up scenario we outline in Chapter
                      3 reflects the potential impact of these types of “no-regret” initiatives; we estimate that
                      roughly 150 million to 300 million jobs could be created incrementally on top of the trendline
                      scenario jobs as a result. Importantly, these initiatives create many middle-skill jobs, such as
                      those for electricians, carpenters, crane operators, and other trades.

                      In prior research, we examined the critical role of migration and gender parity, both of which
                      amount to low-cost ways to boost aggregate demand in the short- and medium-term. For
                      example, as much as 70 percent of population growth in urban areas going forward could
                      come from migration—with key challenges on how migrants can be integrated effectively.110

                      SCALING UP JOB RETRAINING AND WORKFORCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT
                      Providing job retraining and enabling individuals to learn marketable new skills throughout
                      their lifetimes will be a central challenge for some countries over the next decade and
                      beyond. As we have shown in this report, hundreds of millions of people will likely need to
                      find new jobs as automation advances, and even more will need to learn new skills, including
                      how to work seamlessly with machines.

                      In recent years, some countries have experienced significant challenges in trying to create
                      the conditions in which workers displaced by globalization and technology quickly find
                      new high-quality employment. The result for many individuals has been a series of lower-
                      wage jobs with limited opportunities for advancement and lower rates of labor market

                            participation.111 The social consequences can be dire.112 The challenge for the next decades
                            will be to create effective workforce retraining programs at scale. This could require actions
                            by policy makers, business leaders, and educators, as well as individuals.

                            History offers examples of large-scale programs to improve the skills
                            of workers
                            At a time when millions of individuals will need new skills, public funding for job training
                            programs is falling in many countries (Exhibit 27).113 Between 1993 and 2015, spending on
                            workforce training programs as a percent of GDP fell from 0.08 percent to 0.03 percent in
                            the United States, while Japanese spending dropped from 0.03 percent to 0.01 percent. In
                            Germany—still one of the larger spenders—outlays for training fell from 0.57 percent of GDP
                            to 0.2 percent.

                            Nonetheless, we can find examples of societies, past and present, which have chosen
                            to invest in education and workforce training, with impressive results. The United States
                            provides examples of two at-scale investments in the past century: the US High School
                            Movement (1910 to 1940), which made attending secondary school the norm for all children,
                            and the 1944 GI Bill, which enabled millions of returning war veterans to obtain a tertiary
                            education (see Box 6, “The US High School Movement and the GI Bill dramatically raised
                            educational attainment of American workers”). Academic researchers have found that the
                            sizable human capital increases enabled by these programs account for a measurable
                            share of the rise in incomes over those decades, creating a large and increasingly affluent
                            American middle class.114

                            More recently, Singapore implemented an innovative form of support aimed at upgrading

                            Companies also have a significant role to play in training and retraining workers. This goes
                            beyond a purely social role or sense of civic responsibility: business leaders will be on the
                            front lines of automation and will have the earliest and most detailed knowledge about what
                            types of skills they will need as they move to adopt the technologies. In the United States,
                            some companies are working directly with education providers to give employees an
                            opportunity to raise their educational and skill levels (see Box 7, “Some US companies are
                            working with educational providers, even as spending on corporate training declines”).

                                     Traditionally, educational degrees—especially in the fields of science, technology,
                                     engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—have acted as a signal of talent for job hiring.
                                     Lacking other markers of skills, many employees focused on whether candidates have
                                     multi-year, expensive degrees. As the workplace evolves, however, more granular and

                                     credentials is gaining momentum with companies, state governments, and nonprofit
                                     organizations. Markle Foundation, for example, has begun an initiative in Colorado to foster
                                     skills-oriented hiring, training, and education. Among companies supporting it, Microsoft
                                     has announced a grant of more than $25 million to support the program, known as Skillful.117

                                     One intensive approach to corporate training programs merges on-the-job training with
                                     formal education through apprenticeships. These programs exist in many countries,
                                     although participation and graduation rates vary (Exhibit 30).

                      Apprenticeships primarily benefit youth newly entering the workforce. Germany’s “dual-
                      system” apprenticeship program combining work- and school-based learning is the
                      best known, and prepares students for a successful transition to full-time employment.
                      Beginning in secondary school, students choose a vocational or a college-preparation
                      track. Traditionally, this allocation was done through student test scores, but today there is
                      more flexibility. Vocational students spend part of their time attending high school, learning
                      the basic curriculum, and part of their time working and earning at an employer. The system
                      offers qualifications in a broad spectrum of professions and adapts to the changing needs of
                      the labor market.

                      A major strength of the dual system is the high degree of engagement and ownership on
                      the part of employers, although a web of checks and balances at the national and local
                      levels ensures that the short-term needs of employers do not distort broader educational
                      and economic goals.118 The system has produced impressive results: about one-third of
                      German students are educated in the apprenticeship system, which is a widely respected
                      career path.

                      Like Germany, Switzerland also has a robust apprenticeship pipeline—indeed, nearly
                      70 percent of Swiss high-school students choose vocational training. In this track, students
                      rotate between school and workplace settings, and receive a salary throughout their
                      training.119 Some studies show that students in Switzerland who opt into vocational training
                      over general education on average attain higher lifetime earnings.120

                      Germany’s apprenticeship system is being emulated by other countries. For instance,
                      German auto manufacturers in the United States now offer apprenticeships (although the
                      program remains small). South Korea has adopted the apprenticeship model at scale (see
                      Box 8, “South Korea’s Meister schools apprenticeship system”).

                      Box 8. South Korea’s Meister schools apprenticeship system
                      South Korea has one of the highest university enrollment rates in the world, but
                      unemployment rates for graduates have been high, even as small- and medium-sized
                      businesses cannot fill openings for manual and other jobs. The government studied the
                      German and Swiss apprenticeship systems and transformed a subset of existing vocational
                      schools into “Meister” ones. (Meister is German for a skilled craftsman.) Students graduate
                      with the equivalent of two years’ work and/or community college experience. To provide
                      incentives, the Korean government pays the students’ tuition, room, and board.

                      The program is still relatively young, but already bearing fruit: Meister schools have
                      produced significantly higher employment rates among their graduates, more than
                      90 percent, compared with less than 65 percent for college graduates. College enrollment
                      rates have fallen in favor of vocational qualifications as a result.1

112   McKinsey Global Institute          5. Managing the workforce transitions


                            Educators have a role to play in adjusting school curricula for the
                            automation age
                            While automation will be a major challenge to workers already in jobs, it also will have
                            implications for how future generations of workers are trained, involving adjustments to
                            school curricula and education systems more broadly. Curricula will need to adapt to
                            provide students with the skills necessary for a dynamic, technology- and increasingly
                            service-oriented labor market, particularly in countries and industries where automation
                            technologies are likely to be adopted most quickly. Several changes will be required.

                            First, demand will increase for workers to develop and deploy technology, or interpret and
                            act on the data analytics that these technologies can produce, yet there may not be enough
                            workers with the skills to meet this demand, for instance, for data scientists.121 STEM
                            subjects will be crucial for the workforce. Early education in subjects such as statistics, to
                            help students understand an increasingly data-driven world, where experiments are a key
                            source of insight, will be vital. Some countries including Estonia and the United Kingdom
                            have introduced computer coding into primary and secondary education. Coding classes
                            in these countries start as early as age five or seven, with an introduction to necessary
                            fundamental concepts (such as gaining an understanding of algorithms) and coding skills
                            such as logic and the creation and debugging of simple computer programs.122 However,
                            a strong liberal arts education to go alongside the high tech workplace skills could also be
                            required for the “new collar” jobs of the future.123

                            Our analysis has shown that an increasing percentage of activities that workers will do in
                            the future will be in categories such as managing and leading other people and interacting
                            with others, which require skills such as social and emotional sensing and reasoning, and
                            applying creativity and collaborative problem-solving. These skills are often not part of the
                            formal curriculum in traditional school programs. Another finding from our research is that
                            automation and other factors, including globalization, independent work, and companies
                            crossing sector boundaries, will require all workers to change what they do over time. This
                            puts a premium on a set of meta-skills, around agility, flexibility, grit, and learning how to
                            learn. Teaching such qualities is a challenge for all educational systems.

                            Third, educational institutions will need to adapt to the evolving demands of the labor market
                            to ensure that critical job skills are being taught. Unless they become more responsive
                            to labor market demands, educators risk creating an ever-larger disconnect between

                                  It is also important to note that the aims of introducing coding into early education are not to teach specific
                                  computer languages, which change constantly in their popularity, but rather computational thinking.

                      Several measures can reduce or correct disconnects among education providers,
                      employers, and students. Providing actionable data is one. Students need to know that
                      curricula will provide them with relevant knowledge and work skills, and be able to select the
                      best courses and institutions to achieve their desired educational outcome. In one survey,
                      less than 50 percent of students said they had a solid understanding of which disciplines
                      lead to professions with good job openings and wage levels.125

                      Finally, the digital age itself has brought a multitude of possibilities for new ways of learning,
                      both within the educational system and outside. Digital learning resources are more flexible
                      in terms of their timing and content than traditional classroom training, and programs can
                      adjust content for individual students to optimize their learning outcomes. For individuals,
                      online degrees can be more advantageous from a cost perspective than degrees from
                      traditional colleges and universities, particularly in the United States where tuition costs are
                      rising faster than overall inflation. Some massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free and
                      have helped expand access to educational content for those outside traditional educational
                      institutions. At Coursera, for example, half of students are from developing countries, and
                      about 60 to 70 percent of users are employed but preparing for better jobs, while 15 percent
                      are unemployed. Most are between ages 22 and 45.126 MOOCs present a promising
                      channel for at-scale distribution of educational content at low cost and have potential to help
                      ease future workforce transitions. However, their educational impact at scale remains to
                      be seen.127

                      IMPROVING LABOR MARKET DYNAMISM
                      Workers in countries with more fluid labor markets find work more quickly and obtain jobs
                      that are a better fit; this will blunt potential increases in unemployment as automation is
                      adopted. For now, there are significant information asymmetries in the workforce, with poor
                      job matching: companies struggle to find the people they need, and people cannot find the
                      opportunities for which they are best qualified. Both policy changes and new digital tools
                      can help address this challenge.

                      Labor market fluidity has been declining within advanced economies
                      In advanced economies, there is evidence that labor markets are becoming less dynamic,
                      with fewer people switching jobs.128 One striking example is the United States, which has
                      experienced a decline in job reallocation rates since the early 1980s (Exhibit 31).129 The
                      root causes of this decline are not fully understood, but include an aging workforce that
                      is less likely to change jobs, declining rates of new business formation, lower geographic
                      mobility (see next section), and increasing regulations, licensing, and more intense
                      training requirements that have made it harder to join some professions.130 Removing
                      overly burdensome occupational licensing and restrictions, ensuring that benefits are not

                                    Improving geographic mobility can enhance labor market fluidity
                                    While our analysis does not look at the intra-country geography of job loss and job growth,
                                    it is clear that increasing the geographic mobility of the workforce will aid the transition.
                                    Yet labor mobility has declined steadily in many advanced economies.131 In the United
                                    States, geographic mobility has declined since the 1980s (both within and between states),
                                    reversing the increased mobility that was a characteristic of the US labor market earlier in the
                                    20th century.132 Whereas about 3 percent of workers relocated across state lines each year
                                    prior to 1990, that figure has steadily fallen to closer to 1.5 percent today, suggesting that
                                    geographic labor mobility halved within less than 30 years. In Europe, despite the ambition
                                    of creating free movement of people, mobility across borders is still complicated, especially
                                    for services, in which regulating the cross-border posting of workers remains subject to
                                    political disagreements and different labor market regulations. In the European Union,
                                    overall, about 17 million people, or 3 percent of the population, have taken advantage of the
                                    free movement possibilities to live in a different EU country, although the annual flow is one
                                    tenth of that, about 0.3 percent of the population.133

                                    Improving geographic mobility may require regulatory change as well as incentives. One
                                    major obstacle to internal mobility is the cost and availability of housing. Academic literature
                                    has shown that residential mobility is positively correlated with worker reallocation rates and
                                    the efficiency of job matching.134 Lack of information on job opportunities in other areas,
                                    family ties, and different job licensing requirements are also deterrents, as are legal hurdles
                                    such as land-use laws, different eligibility standards for public benefits, state and local tax
                                    regimes, and even basic property law rules.135

                                          Developing countries are experiencing massive migration of workers from rural areas to urban areas as they
                                          urbanize and industrialize.

                      International mobility is a controversial topic in some political arenas, but the skill
                      mismatches we have identified as a consequence of automation and new labor demand
                      will not stop at national borders. Our research on global migration has found that the
                      world’s 247 million cross-border migrants contributed 9.4 percent of global GDP, or roughly
                      $6.7 trillion worldwide in 2015—more than $3 trillion above their contribution had they
                      remained in their home countries.136 More than 90 percent of these cross-border migrants
                      moved voluntarily, usually for economic reasons, while refugees and asylum seekers who
                      tend to attract the most public attention make up the remainder.

                      Digital platforms can make labor markets more transparent and improve
                      job matching
                      Digital platforms offer an efficient way to improve the information available to individuals
                      about job opportunities, and to companies about job candidates. By improving information
                      signals, job platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Monster.com can speed and
                      improve the process of matching individuals to jobs, thereby fostering fluidity. These
                      platforms allow individuals to post their entire resume and showcase their work, displaying a
                      rich set of credentials and skills other than simply their educational record. But transparency
                      cuts both ways: other platforms, such as Glassdoor.com, enable prospective employees to
                      find out more about their potential employers, including salary information and anonymous
                      reviews by current employees. MGI has estimated that up to 540 million individuals could
                      potentially benefit from online talent platforms, with as many as 230 million shortening
                      search times between jobs, reducing the duration of unemployment. Up to 60 million people
                      could find work that more closely suits their skills or preferences, and an additional 50 million
                      could shift from informal to formal employment.137

                      Companies can benefit from using digital technologies to transform recruiting, training,
                      and managing talent as well. Companies that adopt these tools are discovering that better-
                      informed decisions about human capital produce better business results. On average, our
                      analysis finds that companies could see a 275 basis point increase in their profit margins.138
                      In addition, talent platforms could improve signaling about the skills that are actually in
                      demand. As this information shapes decisions about education and training, the supply of
                      skills in the economy could adjust more quickly and accurately over time.

                      Creating more flexible work options may enhance reemployment of
                      displaced workers
                      The workplace is changing, with the rise of more flexible forms of independent work,
                      including independent contractors, freelancers, self-employed individuals, and people
                      working in the “gig” or “sharing” economy. MGI finds that 20 to 30 percent of the working
                      age population in Europe and the United States already earn income through independent
                      work—and that 70 percent of those say they do so out of preference, not because they
                      cannot find a traditional job. Moreover, the number of people choosing to work outside
                      traditional jobs may rise.139 Digital platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer.com, HourlyNerd,
                      Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, eBay, and Airbnb offer vast new markets and lower the barriers to
                      entry, thereby removing some of the risk for those who want to be their own boss.

                      Independent work may offer solutions as well as new challenges. Among the benefits, it can
                      enable many people currently not employed to work in flexible ways that suit their needs.
                      It is particularly attractive for care-givers, retirees, students, and others who need flexible
                      schedules. For the unemployed, independent work may provide a critical bridge to keep
                      earning income while seeking employment. But as independent work grows, questions

                            surrounding benefits, income security measures and other worker protections become
                            more prominent and need to be addressed. Key policy recommendations of the United
                            Kingdom’s Taylor Review in July 2017, for instance, included recommendations to expand
                            the definition of “worker,” extend minimum wage standards, and ensure that benefits such
                            as holiday and sick pay cover independent workers.140

                            PROVIDING TRANSITION AND INCOME SUPPORT TO WORKERS
Germany’s labor             Job losses cause economic stress, as well as physical, emotional, and psychological
market reforms in           distress. A wide body of academic research has found correlations between extended
the 1990s helped            unemployment and declines in physical and mental health. Studies have even shown poorer
raise its share of          academic outcomes among the children of the long-term unemployed.141 Other research
                            has documented the stagnation in market incomes, and increasing wage polarization,
the working-age
                            in many developed markets.142 Both policy makers and business leaders have a role to
population in
                            play in supporting workers as they transition between jobs to avoid long-term negative
employment by
                            consequences and to ensure that they receive adequate incomes.

                            Actively supporting workers in job transitions
                            A range of measures can speed the transition of workers between jobs, beyond improving
                            labor market dynamism, job matching, and retraining and skill development. Most countries
                            have labor agencies focused on providing assistance to the unemployed. In many, the focus
                            is mainly on doling out benefits and reducing fraud. Germany provides an example of a
                            nation that overhauled its labor force system—and reduced high unemployment as a result.
                            In 2003, when the country was still struggling with the legacy of reunification, it adopted the
                            “Hartz reforms,” based on recommendations of a labor market commission. The lower-
                            wage segment of the labor market was liberalized, and a new category of jobs was created
                            with employers paying a low flat rate for employees, who work a limited number of hours per
                            week, exempt from social security and tax contributions.

                            The move created millions of “mini-jobs,” whose wages were then supplemented by welfare
                            payments. In addition, the local labor market agencies were restructured. Case workers
                            are assigned to every unemployed individual, with strong incentives to successfully place
                            their clients into jobs. Skills assessments are performed, and training is provided if needed.
                            These reforms helped reduce the unemployment rate from 10 percent in 2003 to below
                            4 percent today and, at the same time, increased Germany’s share of the working-age
                            population in employment by 10 percentage points. While these reforms have returned
                            more individuals to work, there is controversy over the impact on the post-unemployment
                            earnings of workers.143

                            To ensure that workers develop the skills needed for the working world of the future,
                            the German labor agency is now planning to put a greater emphasis on counseling. It is
                            currently piloting innovative online and offline counseling services directed at students, the
                            unemployed, but also employees in jobs which are massively impacted by digitization. The
                            hope is that better individual orientation about job market trends and future opportunities
                            will smooth the transition to a digital economy, without a large net loss of jobs and
                            corresponding increase in unemployment.

                      In Denmark, employers and governments work with unions to maintain the country’s
                      “flexicurity system,” which combines active labor market policies with flexible rules for
                      hiring and firing and high levels of benefits for unemployed individuals (up to 90 percent for
                      the lowest paid workers). They also offer active job counseling, including career guidance,
                      training or education to all unemployed individuals, and offer all workers access to
                      numerous vocational training programs. This creates a labor market environment of flexible
                      employment and job security. Notably, firms and unions get together to identify skills needs,
                      agree on wages and enshrine rights to paid leave for training. Some studies suggest that
                      similar collaborative efforts between employers and unions can play an important role in
                      raising skill levels, including in the United States, and are already doing so in some cases.144

                      Neighboring Sweden has a system for retraining midcareer workers through private sector
                      “job-security councils.” Employers pay into these councils, which provide financial support
                      and job counseling to laid-off workers, with the aim of helping them get back to work as
                      soon as possible. Personal counselors help workers with their resumes and steer them into
                      classes in their fields or other fields.145

                      Supporting worker incomes may also be necessary
                      Our research indicates that millions of individuals will likely need to transition to new
                      occupations—and identifies the risk that wages may become stagnant or even decline for
                      middle and lower-skill occupations that have a large supply of potential workers but might
                      have reduced demand, particularly in developed economies. Supporting incomes in both
                      cases may have an economic rationale. Consider that in 1914, Henry Ford announced that
                      he would begin paying his employees $5 per day, more than twice the average wage for
                      automakers, and reduce the work day from nine hours to eight, at a time when the 60-hour
                      work week was the standard in American manufacturing. He explained that “unless an
                      industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low, it destroys itself, for
                      otherwise it limits the number of its customers. One’s own employees ought to be one’s own
                      best customers.”146

                      Two forms of income support need consideration in the age of automation. First are
                      payments such as unemployment insurance to provide income to workers during training
                      or transitioning between jobs. Yet unfortunately, the amount of public resources devoted to
                      supporting worker transitions—including on unemployment benefits—has been declining
                      in most countries (Exhibit 32). Given the large workforce transitions we see in the decades
                      ahead, re-evaluating this trend could be necessary.

                      In addition, however, wages may be under pressure in a wide range of jobs as economies
                      transition to new forms of work. A range of options exists for addressing these income
                      effects. Some employers can choose to pay higher wages and better benefits, recognizing
                      the value that their workers are producing. In addition to societal responsibility, these
                      companies may be motivated by competition for talent and an interest in reducing employee
                      turnover. In the United States some companies have unilaterally raised minimum wages they
                      pay.147 In Europe, companies have traditionally paid more attention to stakeholders such as
                      workers, in part because of unionization and regulatory choices; in Germany, for example,
                      worker representatives sit on corporate boards under 1976 “codetermination” legislation
                      and play an important role in shaping wage and benefit policies, as well as overall corporate
                      strategy. There are also policy options for providing income support to workers to ensure
                      that they remain active consumers. Minimum wages are widely deployed throughout the
                      world, and there are moves to raise them, including in US cities such as Seattle.148 While
                      some studies have shown that increasing minimum wages can raise employment, the issue
                      is actively debated. Other forms of income support, such as “earned income tax credits”
                      and wage subsidies, provide incentives for people to work. These measures attempt to
                      provide income support without discouraging people from working. Pilot projects are
                      underway in a number of countries to test the idea of paying a universal basic income (see
                      Box 9, “Experimenting with universal basic income”).

                      In recent decades, the long-standing correlation between rising productivity and wage
                      growth has broken down in some countries, such as the United States. The cause of this
                      shift is unclear. But policy makers are considering new ways to ensure that wages are
                      linked to rising productivity, so that prosperity is shared with all. Some have suggested
                      that minimum wages should be indexed to measures of productivity. In another specific
                      example, Singapore has a program that supports corporate investments in productivity
                      on condition companies share the gains from productivity improvements with low-wage
                      workers.149 Between 2010, when the program was launched, and 2013, more than 800
                      projects were launched, most of them by small and medium-sized enterprises, which will
                      benefit 53,000 workers once completed. Their wage increases are more than 10 percentage
                      points above the national average.

                                                                               •••

                      In the new era of automation, governments and businesses will need to undertake a
                      balancing act between embracing the technology, which will boost productivity and
                      economic growth, and at the same time addressing the complex transitions it will create.
                      Ensuring robust demand growth and economic dynamism is a priority: history shows that
                      economies that are not expanding do not generate job growth. Upgrading workforce skills
                      and creating opportunities for midcareer job retraining will also be essential, at a time when
                      spending on these has been declining in most countries, and labor markets will need to
                      become more dynamic and adaptable to changing work needs and patterns of worker
                      redeployment. A final priority is reassessing and strengthening transition and income
                      support for workers caught in the cross-currents of automation. Each of these priorities
                      on its own presents a challenge, and all together may require a Marshall Plan-like initiative,
                      involving clear focus and investment. In the concluding chapter, we examine the implications
                      for policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers.

6. PRIORITIES FOR GOVERNMENT,
BUSINESS, AND INDIVIDUALS
Automation will be a powerful motor of future economic growth, but the challenges it
presents for workforce transitions are sure to be very substantial. Policy makers, business
leaders, and individual workers will need to be flexible, creative, and even visionary as they
look to harness these rapidly-emerging technologies and ensure that the time of automation
is a productive and prosperous one. A range of outcomes is possible, from one in which
economic growth and productivity grow strongly, creating myriad new jobs, as automation
is adopted rapidly, to one marked by slow automation adoption, weak economic growth and
low net job growth.

Faced with the scale of worker transitions we have described, one reaction could be to try
to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve as much of the status quo
as possible. But this would be a mistake. Although slower adoption might limit the scale
of workforce transitions, it would curtail the contributions that these technologies make
to business dynamism and economic growth. Automation technologies and in particular
artificial intelligence are the key to finding solutions for many important societal challenges in
fields ranging from climate science to health care. We should embrace these technologies,
but also address the workforce transitions and challenges they bring. To do this, there are
a number of imperatives and priorities for governments, business, and individuals. In this
concluding chapter, we highlight a number of them.

GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS AND JOB
CREATION A MORE URGENT PRIORITY
Managing the coming workforce transitions with foresight is not just a question of smart
policy. Automation’s power to lift the productivity of national economies has the potential to
accelerate productivity and economic growth and improve lives. Governments can support
the development and deployment of these technologies, for example through investments
in basic and applied research, as well as through building out digital infrastructure. Ensuring
positive employment outcomes will require a laser focus on retooling the workforce,
stepping up support for workers in transition, and improving how local and national labor
markets function. Societies can choose to transform the coming labor market disruptions
into an opportunity rather than a pitfall.

As daunting as the task may seem, history shows us that governments, across the globe,
when faced with monumental challenges, can rise to the occasion for the well-being of their
citizens. As we have seen, the US High School Movement and GI Bill were instrumental in
raising the education of the US workforce and countries such as Germany have shown that
revamping labor market agencies and support for workers in transition is not only possible
but can also dramatically reduce unemployment. Such examples highlight the importance
of executing targeted policy decisions swiftly and clearly.

Yet in the last few decades, investments and policies to support the workforce have eroded,
not been enhanced. Public spending on labor force training and support has fallen in most
countries. Educational models have not fundamentally changed in 100 years; we still use
systems designed for an industrial society to prepare students for a more dynamic, rapidly-
changing knowledge economy. Unions are on the decline. Government data collection
on the growing independent workforce and new ways of working is fragmented. It is now
critical to reverse these trends. A new “Marshall Plan” for the workforce is needed. Priorities
include the four areas for action discussed at length in Chapter 5, but also the following:


                       Radically scale midcareer training opportunities to make lifelong learning a reality.
                         Lifelong learning has long been talked about reverentially in policy circles, but the new
                         age of automation will be the time when large-scale application of it will be needed more
                         than ever. Flexibility and adaptability will be the new workforce mantras, as machines
                         both replace some human activities and—probably more frequently—fundamentally
                         change them. Recent examples of effective large-scale retraining of midcareer workers
                         are few and far apart. For the future, more short-term and targeted training for people will
                         be needed, especially for those in midcareer who will be looking to develop new skills
                         even if they keep their jobs.

                       Modernize educational systems for the 21st century. Our analysis of the
                         performance capabilities most in demand in the new age of automation shows the
                         critical importance of technology skills, but also of teamwork, creativity, communication,
                         and social and emotional skills. Schools in many countries continue to adhere to
                         a culture of education that remains rooted in 19th century notions of teaching and
                         learning. Governments and educators can use digital technologies to change that, for
                         example creating more individual learning paths for students. Several countries including
                         Germany and Switzerland continue to show that apprenticeships can be a powerful and
                         successful approach to teaching technical skills. While university education has grown
                         in popularity and lost its elitist reputation in many countries, many tertiary educational
                         institutions have not focused sufficiently on the needs of the labor market or of the
                         graduates entering it. Publishing job placement of graduates and similar data could
                         help both employers looking for recruits and potential students trying to decide on their
                         course of study. Singapore has shown through its SkillsFuture Initiative that individuals
                         can be supported and motivated to continuously acquire new skills. Finally, governments
                         could encourage, identify, and co-finance innovative pilot programs that address known
                         skills gaps among workers, post-secondary students, and youth—and then scale the
                         ones that work.

                       Expand transition support measures for workers. Denmark, Germany, and Sweden,
                         among others, have shown the importance of focusing labor agencies on reemployment
                         and the acquisition of new skills, rather than simply on handing out unemployment
                         benefits or controlling for fraud. Best practice requires a cultural shift of sorts, one that
                         nudges workers to take a more active role in their own retraining and provides tools for
                         them to be successful. Mobility can be an important part of that transition process, and
                         in the United States, at least, it was long prized. However, mobility within borders has
                         slowed in advanced countries including the United States, and mobility across borders
                         faces new hurdles globally as countries revisit immigration policies and practices.
                         Reducing the barriers to mobility—which include legal ones alongside prohibitive
                         housing costs—will need to be a policy priority. And governments should not lose sight
                         of the cardinal importance of increasing economic mobility and opportunity for all
                         citizens. That means universal access to quality education, good neighborhoods, and
                         basic healthcare.

                       Create income support measures consistent with the new wage realities.
                         Since 1970, market wages and productivity growth have diverged in some advanced
                         economies including the United States, and income inequality has grown. With the
                         advent of the new automation age, it is important to begin national discussions on
                         whether we can assume that everyone who works can support a decent standard
                         of living. A healthy consumer class is essential for both economic growth and social
                         stability. Income supplementation programs already exist in certain countries, such
                         as the earned income tax credit in the United States, and some countries are testing
                         universal basic income programs or raising minimum wages; more could follow suit, to
                         provide fact-based findings that can inform the debate.


124   McKinsey Global Institute     6. Priorities for government, business, and individuals


                             Make job creation and worker re-deployment a national priority. A broad range
                               of incentives exists for businesses to invest in capital and research and development.
                               Something similar is needed to encourage investment in human capital. In addition,
                               governments could assess the impact on job creation of their policies and investments,
                               much as they currently assess the impact of policies on the environment. Companies
                               could be encouraged to invest in worker training and redeployment through tax and
                               other incentives, just as they often are for their research and development investments;
                               in some countries, that will mean reconsidering tax codes that provide subsidies
                               (through interest) for investments in capital while taxing labor. The step-up scenario
                               in this report showed the value in job-creation terms of raising public—and, with it,
                               private—investment in infrastructure, affordable housing, and energy efficiency and
                               climate change. Such investment will need to go hand-in-hand with other backing for
                               job creation, including supporting entrepreneurship and small business creation by
                               streamlining regulations and revisiting personal bankruptcy laws that discourage risk-
                               taking, for example.

                             Modernize data collection on the labor market. Government surveys of households
                               and employers are the gold standard of national economic data. But these are time-
                               consuming. In today’s dynamically changing world, governments need to supplement
                               these surveys with real-time data on the adoption of automation technologies,
                               job openings, labor market dynamism, skills in demand, and how individuals are
                               coping with job transitions.150 The need for better data amounts to an opportunity for
                               government statistics agencies to collaborate with online sources of data, including
                               job boards, professional sites such as LinkedIn, and private tech companies, to obtain
                               a more detailed and accurate picture of jobs, skills, wages, and individual mobility and
                               career moves.

                            BUSINESS LEADERS SHOULD EMBRACE AUTOMATION AND AI WHILE
                            CAREFULLY MANAGING WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS

                            Business leaders also have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies,
                            enabling performance benefits such as quality and speed, as well as greater efficiency and
                            productive use of all factors of production. But businesses will also be on the front lines of

                               countries, developing an automation and AI strategy should be a priority. So far, few firms
                               have deployed at scale. In an MGI survey of 3,000 AI-aware C-level executives, across
                               10 countries and 14 sectors, only 20 percent said they use any AI related technology
                               in a core part of their businesses. Many firms say they are uncertain of the business

                               was deployed commercially in only 12 percent of cases.151 But companies that ignore
                               these technologies do so at their peril: the gap in performance between early adopters

                            of digital technologies in general and AI in particular is widening. In the MGI survey,
                            early AI adopters have higher profit margins. Our case studies in retail, electric utilities,
                            manufacturing, health care, and education highlight automation and AI’s potential to
                            improve forecasting and sourcing, optimize and automate operations, develop targeted
                            marketing and pricing, and enhance the customer experience.

                       Redesign businesses processes to unlock productivity gains. Since the IT
                         revolution began in the 1990s it has been clear that capturing the value from new
                         technologies requires reimagining how the business operates, rather than mechanically
                         applying automation to the current mix of activities and processes. Capturing the full
                         opportunities offered by automation will require companies to conduct a thorough review
                         of business processes and workflows and assess where automation could improve
                         performance the most. That in turn requires companies to develop or acquire the talent,
                         discipline, and know-how to implement the sort of changes that will be needed to
                         harness the full potential of automation.

                       Rethink organizational design. Automation adoption is a process that will not happen
                         overnight, and the workplace norm for years to come will be people working alongside
                         machines. This has profound implications for the way companies and their workforce are
                         structured and organized. Until recently, for example, powerful manufacturing robots that
                         can lift or weld have been kept well away from humans, often in cages, because of the
                         risk of accidents. But today’s robots can work intelligently and safely alongside humans.
                         Such machine-human and machine-machine environments will become more pervasive,
                         and that in turn will require workflows to change. Successfully rethinking organizational
                         design will ensure that work is not only more productive and takes advantage of the new
                         technical possibilities available, but that it will become more meaningful and rewarding
                         for people, as the rote aspects of their jobs are taken over by machines, freeing them
                         to use more innate human qualities including social and emotional reasoning and
                         personal interaction.

                       Build core digital and analytics capabilities. Companies that successfully adopt the
                         latest automation and AI technologies typically already have strong digital capabilities.
                         Indeed, our analysis shows that companies that are early adopters of AI are also
                         digital leaders. There is no shortcut to creating a strong digital base. Companies will
                         need to build the supporting digital assets, big data and analytics capabilities to make
                         automation and AI a success. This includes building the data ecosystem and adopting
                         the right advanced analytic techniques and tools.152

                       Adapt talent strategy and manage workforce transitions. Business leaders will
                         need to ensure that the talent their companies require to transition to more automated
                         operations is in place. This will involve a combination of recruiting automation-savvy
                         professionals, as well as retraining workers to play new roles. Determining the right mix
                         of current talent, redeployed talent, and new talent from outside the company will require
                         careful consideration. In the new era, STEM talent and data scientists will be increasingly
                         important—and could provide a lasting competitive advantage. But filling new technical
                         positions is expensive and time-consuming because we have not been turning out
                         enough skilled professionals to keep up with the demand. In the United States, for
                         instance, data scientist shortages are already appearing.153

                             Consider partnerships for talent development. Some companies are turning to
                               partnerships to develop the skills needed in their workforce and help smooth transitions.
                               As we noted in Chapter 5, some companies have begun to establish partnerships with
                               universities and other educational institutions to provide training and skill development
                               in their workforces. This enables large-scale retraining, without creating the staff and
                               overhead to manage it internally. Such partnerships may become more common as
                               companies adopt automation at scale. In the future, as technical talent shortages
                               increase, corporate partnership with universities and colleges may become more
                               frequent as companies seek to develop a reliable pipeline of scarce technical talent.
                               In other sectors, such as health care and manufacturing, there are many examples of
                               companies partnering with local community colleges to shape and create the curricula
                               for specific degree programs. Similar collaborations might increase the availability of
                               data scientists and other technology-related professionals.

                            INDIVIDUALS MUST PREPARE FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AND
                            EVOLVING CAREERS
                            Individuals will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolving future of work. Acquiring new skills
                            that are in demand and resetting intuition about the world of work will be critical for well-
                            being. Workers everywhere will need to reexamine traditional notions of where they work,
                            how they work, and what talents and capabilities they bring to that work.

                             Embrace a “startup of you” mentality. In the rapidly changing future of work,
                               individuals will be in charge of their own destiny more than ever. The days of planning
                               to have one employer for life are long gone. All individuals will need to adopt a more
                               entrepreneurial approach to navigating through the world of work and managing their
                               careers. Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, calls it the “startup of you” approach.154
                               Individuals will become more proficient and comfortable with navigating a more digital
                               job search and managing their personal profiles.

                             Acquire the skills that will be in demand and embark on a journey of lifelong
                               learning. As machines perform a wider range and variety of tasks, individuals will need
                               to put more focus on developing the skills that humans excel at. As we have described
                               in this report, the activities in nearly all occupations will change, with more time spent
                               on those activities that require social and emotional skills, team work and collaboration,
                               creativity, and higher levels of communication and logical reasoning. Both governments
                               and businesses have a role to play in providing individuals with better information on the
                               skills and jobs in demand. Educators play a part as well. Secondary school students in
                               most countries receive inadequate instruction and guidance on how to plan a career in
                               today’s workplace, and even less so for a workplace that is rapidly evolving. Ultimately it
                               will be up to individuals themselves to think carefully about what skills will be needed and
                               how they can demonstrate those skills to employers.

                             Prepare for a world of digital job search. Digital platforms for matching people with
                               jobs and assessing skills are rapidly becoming the norm for hiring.155 Individuals will
                               need to use these technologies if they are to be competitive in the job market. In the
                               short term, this means putting time and care into building a personal online presence.
                               To stand out, they will need to showcase their experience, establish expertise by joining
                               groups or posting content, and build their professional networks. Workers could also
                               benefit from understanding and participating in the innovations around skills-based
                               training and credentials that could accelerate their career trajectories. Individuals without
                               formal education credentials may be able to differentiate themselves through their online
                               reputation via recommendations from former customers or employers.

                       Consider new ways of working. Not only do most people now cycle through multiple
                         employers throughout their careers, but many are moving beyond the traditional full-
                         time (or part-time) job altogether. As many as 30 percent of workers in the United States
                         and Europe earn part or most of their income through independent work—that is,
                         freelance activities, self-employment, or through rapidly expanding digital gig or sharing
                         platforms.156 More than 70 percent of those individuals say that they prefer independent
                         work and they report higher satisfaction with many aspects of their work-life than people
                         with traditional jobs, including not only flexibility, but also opportunities for advancement,
                         creativity and variety in their work, and even more security in their income. Roughly half
                         of independent workers supplement their income from traditional jobs (or pensions) with
                         these activities. In a world where wages are depressed for people without the skills in
                         demand, independent work offers an opportunity to enhance incomes and branch out
                         into new areas.

                      Ultimately, automation may force us all to reassess basic notions of work. In capitalist
                      economies, individuals earn most of their income through applying their labor; except for
                      the disabled, all of us are born with an endowment of labor from which to earn income, but
                      only a privileged few are born with capital. In many decades hence, the value of this labor
                      may be diminished if we reach a state in which machines can do a large share of the work.
                      For workers around the world, policy makers, and business leaders—and not just social
                      scientists who specialize in socio-economic paradigms—that should give pause for thought,
                      and be a spur for action.

                                                                               •••

                      Automation represents both hope and challenge. The global economy needs the boost to
                      productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when aging populations are
                      acting as a drag on GDP growth. For companies, the technologies can lift productivity and
                      profits to new heights. For society as a whole, machines can take on work that is routine,
                      dangerous, or dirty, and may allow us all to use our intrinsically human talents more fully and
                      enjoy more leisure. Yet even as we benefit, our societies will need to prepare for complex
                      transitions ahead, as machines replace workers in many areas. Our research suggests that
                      it may be time to refocus the current anxious debate about automation toward issues of
                      demand growth, and how to manage the inevitable transitions created by automation. The
                      task at hand is to prepare for a more automated future by emphasizing the skills that will be
                      needed and ensuring dynamic job creation. The technology is advancing rapidly; the policy
                      choices should not tarry.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX

This appendix provides details on the methodology employed in our research in the
following sections:

1. Work hours that could be automated

2. Labor demand drivers

3. Macroeconomic analysis

4. Skills and wages analysis

5. Glossary of automation technologies and techniques




1. WORK HOURS THAT COULD BE AUTOMATED
This report continues and adapts the methodology and findings of the January 2017
McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment and
productivity. A full methodology of that work is detailed in its technical appendix; we will
provide only a brief summary here and how it is applied in this report.

In that report, the technical potential for automation of the global economy and projected
adoption rates are determined by an analysis of the underlying work activities for each
occupation, covering 46 countries. It uses databases published by institutions including
the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 O*Net database to break down
about 800 occupations into more than 2,000 activities, and determines the performance
capabilities needed for each activity based on the way humans currently perform them.
The report further breaks down activity into 18 capabilities and assesses their technical
automation potential. This framework is informed by academic research, internal expertise,
and industry experts. Our report focuses on 2016–30, and thus takes the automation
adoption percentage through 2030. Much of the occupational data, at the time of original
analysis, was harmonized through 2014. We adopted the simplification of referring to 2016
as  the starting
Exhibit  A4      point of the analysis, and projecting in 2014 data (such as occupational mix)
into 2016 baseline (for example, automation adoption percentages).




   Equations
In this report, we use these findings to size the number of jobs that could be automated
by 2030. We make an assumption that each hour of work that could be automated will
result in proportional job loss, for example if 10 percent of current work activity hours in an
occupation will be automated, then 10 percent of jobs in that occupation will be displaced. A
priori, it is unclear if this assumption is conservative or aggressive. Based on what we have
seen historically, we expect in many cases that the result of activities being automated will
be a redistribution of efforts on other existing or new activities. However, it is also possible
that with automation, existing work processes could be radically overhauled and reduced
in complexity, reducing labor demand even further beyond automation potential of current
activities. We have not modeled these countervailing effects.


           Jobs lost = (1 – weighted automation potential) × 2030 labor force


                      To calculate the work hours automated in 2030, we multiply the automation adoption
                      percentage by the size of the labor force in 2030. By doing this, we assume that the
                      occupation mix of the economy and the underlying work activities in each occupation in
                      2030 are the same as today. This is a conservative assumption, because in reality, we would
                      expect that jobs will not be added back at the same occupation mix and that new jobs will
                      be added in less automatable sectors.

                      To estimate the size of the 2030 labor force, we use population projections from the United
                      Nations, labor force participation projections from the International Labour Organization,
                      and the natural unemployment rate for OECD countries. For countries outside the OECD, we
                      use the maximum unemployment rate of either 2007 or 2012 to adjust for the effects of the
                      2008 global financial crisis on unemployment.




                      2. LABOR DEMAND DRIVERS
                      Our work examines the labor demand created by seven catalysts. We selected these seven
                      from a shortlist of 20 after conducting high-level sizing calculations to estimate their potential
                      to create labor demand by 2030.

                      For catalysts that include a per capita metric, such as spend on automobiles or number of
                      health-care professionals, we include population growth through 2030 based on projection
                      from the United Nations.

                      We capture direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each catalyst, take into
                      account the decline in hours worked per person, and factor in globalization of work. Our
                      model offers a static view of the potential labor demand that could be created from the
                      seven drivers and does not factor in supply-demand dynamics and feedback from factors
                      such as changes in wage levels. It estimates potential labor demand; whether this potential
                      is captured will depend on the choices and investments made by businesses, policy-
                      makers, and workers. The scenarios we construct do not take into account any sources of
                      labor demand outside of our seven drivers that could play an important role in determining
                      the future of work. We do not model entirely new industries and occupations that could
                      exist in the future, in part enabled by technology; studies have shown that on average,
                      0.5 percent of the workforce has been working in “new jobs” per year in the past couple
                      of decades.157 We do not take into account sectoral shifts in industries that are not directly
                      related to automation, such as the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not model
                      changes in work structure, such as the growth of the “gig” economy, or activities within an
                      occupation that could change as a result of technological innovation.

                                 Increased prosperity is the underlying driver of many (but not all) of the labor demand
                                 sizings. Given the static modular modeling approach that we have taken, we have taken
                                 GDP per capita growth as an input to our driver models.

                                 We use the McKinsey Global Growth Model (GGM) projections. The GGM is a global
                                 macroeconomic model that tracks long term economic trends and generates projections
                                 under a range of scenarios. For the inputs to our labor demand modeling, we use the GGM’s
                                 baseline scenario where available. For countries that the GGM does not model and for
                                 Japan and Mexico, we use projections from Oxford Economics. See Exhibit A1 for the GDP/
                                 capita projections in use.

                                 For drivers of labor demand in which we are modelling an increase in spend, we use job
                                 multipliers from input-output tables to calculate the number of jobs created through each
                                 additional dollar of spend. In many drivers based on linear regression analysis (for example,
                                 rising consumer spending), the general sizing approach for the number of jobs created
                                 incremental to 2014 levels is captured in the following formula:

                                      Net new jobs =

                                      (2030 spend per capita × 2030 population × 2030 I – 0 multiplier)

                                      – (2014 spend per capita × 2014 projected population × 2014 I – 0 multiplier)


                                 To take into account projected increases in productivity between 2014 and 2030, we adjust
                                 2014 job multipliers for projected productivity gains (from factors other than automation) to
                                 create a 2030 job multiplier.

                                 For all labor drivers, we calculate indirect jobs using indirect job multipliers from McKinsey

                      Globalization of trade
                      For drivers that include tradable goods and services, we use data from the International
                      Trade Organization and IHS Global Insight to model level of imports and exports in our 46
                      country set. In drivers with global trade, we model both locally- and globally-driven labor
                      demand. We keep this model of global trade constant between today and 2030, as shifts
                      in globalization are beyond the scope of our analysis. This approach would result in an
                      underestimation of job creation in countries whose global export shares in 2030 would be
                      greater than today’s shares, and similarly overestimation of job creation in countries whose
                      share of global exports in 2030 would be lower than today’s.

                      Trendline and step-up scenarios
                      For three of our seven drivers—infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings, energy
                      transitions and efficiency—we model two scenarios. These are a trendline scenario, based
                      on the observed patterns across countries that vary by factors such as GDP per capita,
                      and a step-up scenario, which is based on further changes that could boost labor demand
                      above the trendline scenario. For our seventh driver, the marketization of previously unpaid
                      work, we have only modeled a step-up scenario. We describe the assumptions for these
                      scenarios in the relevant sections below.

                      Catalyst 1: Rising incomes
                      Our rising incomes driver represents increase in consumer spending as well as overall
                      spending on health care and education that results from increased prosperity (that is, rising
                      GDP per capita) in countries. We have taken GDP per capita projections as an exogenous
                      input to our modeling for all drivers related to change in spend.

                      For consumer spending, we use univariate regression analysis to identify spending trends
                      by category using 2014 GDP per capita and 2014 consumption per capita data for the
                      46 countries in our model. While GDP per capita changes from 2014 to 2030 as the
                      independent variable, we model change in spend by category for accommodation and food
                      services, automobiles, clothing, financial services, food, household goods, leisure goods,
                      leisure services, and utilities. (We exclude some categories of consumer spending to avoid
                      double counting, such as public transport, which could overlap with our infrastructure
                      driver). An adjustment is made across categories to cap overall consumption, to ensure
                      that our regression analyses do not imply a major shift in consumption per capita. To do
                      this, we scale overall consumption to a low and high scenario, based on consumption per
                      capita projections from the GGM. We then multiply the 2014 and 2030 spend by 2014 and
                      2030 job multipliers, respectively. The productivity-adjusted 2030 job multiplier accounts
                      for an increase in productivity, which drives some consumption categories to have negative
                      job growth in countries where productivity growth outstrips demand growth, such as the
                      agriculture sector in India. Additionally, we use indirect job multipliers to capture the demand
                      created in other sectors that supply to these sectors.

                      Goods and services modeled under rising incomes are determined to be tradable or non-
                      tradable, and the labor demand for those which are tradable is distributed according to 2014
                      levels of global trade.

                      Given the discrepancies between countries in funding models for education and health care,
                      these drivers have been sized separately from the rest of consumer spending, despite some
                      proportion of education and health care spending being funded directly by consumers. For
                      both these sectors, we model the full sector, which would include that funded by consumers
                      as well as public and private sector funding.

                                   Net new jobs =

                                   (2030 spend per capita × 2030 population × 2030 I – 0 multiplier)

                                 – (2014 spend per capita × 2014 projected population × 2014 I – 0 multiplier)
                            We see a trend towards increased numbers of jobs in education as GDP per capita rises.
                            We model this relationship through univariate regressions on student-teacher ratios and
                            gross enrollment rates across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels using 2014 data for
                            all 46 countries in our model. We also capture the effect of aging populations; if there is low
                            population growth and the population is aging, this decreases education jobs, and vice
                            versa. The general formula we use is:


                                                         2030 student age population
                                                                                               × 2030 GER
                                                                    2030 STR

                                                            2014 student age population
                                                     –                                              × 2014 GER
                                                                        2014 STR


                            We use this to model projected education jobs in 2030, then subtract the number of jobs in
                            2014 to size the incremental labor demand in education. We then use indirect job multipliers
                            to capture jobs created in other sectors that are suppliers to the education sector.

                            Catalyst 2: Health care: Rising incomes and aging
                            In addition to rising incomes increasing demand for jobs in health care, aging populations
                            in many countries will likewise raise health-care demand. We model these effects of rising
                            incomes and aging together to avoid double-counting the increase in healthcare jobs.

                            The change in the number of health-care jobs is modeled through bivariate linear regression
                            with 2014 GDP per capita and aging (share of population over 65 in 2014) as independent
                            variables and health-care professionals per 1000 people in 2014 as the dependent variable
                            for all 46 countries in our model. We use this trendline to model the increase in health-care
                            professionals as GDP per capita increases and population ages from 2014 to 2030 levels.
                            We include all parts of the health-care delivery sector including hospital care, home care,
                            nursing homes, and other support roles. We then use indirect job multipliers to capture jobs
                            created in other sectors that are suppliers to the health-care sector.

                            Catalyst 3: Development and deployment of new technology
                            We identify trends between rising GDP per capita and spend on information technology. For
                            enterprise IT spend, we find that a country’s GDP is correlated with the amount spent on
                            hardware, software, and IT services. For consumer technology spend, we consider only the
                            hardware and software components of spend, and find that the richer the population (i.e.
                            the higher GDP per capita) the higher spend on technology goods. We use univariate linear
                            regression analyses to find a relationship between 2014 GDP per capita as the independent
                            variable and each category of IT spend per capita in 2014 (including consumer and
                            enterprise spending) as the dependent variable across all 46 countries. These categories
                            of IT spend are then multiplied by productivity-adjusted job multipliers for 2014 and 2030
                            to calculate net new jobs. All data is based on historical baselines from Gartner’s Market
                            Databook published in the first quarter of 2017.158 Finally, we use indirect multipliers to
                            capture jobs created in sectors supplying to the IT sector.

                      As the consumer technology element of rising incomes is captured within this driver, we
                      omit it from the rising incomes driver. Likewise, since telecommunications and electric
                      utilities are captured in the infrastructure driver, we did not consider increase in technology
                      infrastructure spend as part of our technology definition in order to avoid double-counting.
                      Finally, this driver assumes technology spend growth according to current trends and thus
                      does not consider the scenarios of extraordinary technology spend that are possible in
                      more rapid automation scenarios.

                      Catalyst 4: Infrastructure investment
                      In our trendline scenarios for infrastructure investment, we conduct univariate regression
                      analyses with GDP per capita as the independent variable and infrastructure spend per
                      capita as the dependent variable on 2014 cross-country data. From this, we estimate
                      infrastructure spend in 2014 and in 2030, using GDP per capita projections. These 2014
                      and 2030 infrastructure spend numbers are then multiplied by 2014 and 2030 job multipliers
                      for the construction sector, respectively, to estimate jobs in each year. 2030 job multipliers,
                      as with other catalysts, are calculated using productivity growth as discussed below. The
                      difference is the incremental addition of new infrastructure jobs between 2014 and 2030.

                      In our step-up scenario, we model a step-up in which countries have increased their
                      infrastructure stock to a global benchmark of 70.5 percent of total GDP. This results in
                      higher run-rate infrastructure spending in order to attain and maintain the infrastructure
                      70.5 percent benchmark, accounting for both GDP growth (accelerated in our step-up
                      scenario) and depreciation. In all, this amounts to between $4 trillion and $4.5 trillion
                      annual spending for economic infrastructure (transport, water, and power) compared
                      with $2.1 trillion to $3 trillion in the trendline scenario. We assume annual non-automation
                      productivity increases ranging from 1.5 percent to 4.8 percent in some emerging market
                      countries based on historical trends (1.5 percent in China, 4.8 percent in Kenya, Nigeria,
                      and the Philippines, and no productivity increases elsewhere). By the same method as the
                      trendline scenario, we multiply 2014 and 2030 spend by job multipliers for the construction
                      sector to estimate gross new jobs. Included in the ranges of our step-up scenario estimate
                      are additional annual non-automation productivity increases in the remaining emerging
                      market countries of 2.5 percent. This productivity adjustment would better indicate the
                      range of possible outcomes in emerging market countries; in advanced economies, given
                      low historical growth in productivity, we do not assume non-automation productivity will
                      increase even in the low range of the step-up scenario. Finally, we use indirect job multipliers
                      to capture jobs created in sectors that supply the construction sector.

                      Catalyst 5: Residential and commercial buildings
                      As with infrastructure, we have modeled two scenarios for residential and commercial
                      buildings. For the trendline scenario, we again conduct univariate regression analyses,
                      just as we did for infrastructure. For the step-up scenario, we model an increase of stock
                      in structures to a US benchmark of 2.3 times that of total GDP, in line with data from the
                      Bureau of Economic Analysis, and adjust downward for double-counting with infrastructure,
                      inclusion of industrial structures, and spending on equipment outside of the construction
                      sector. This amounted to $8.2 trillion to $9.8 trillion annual spending for buildings and
                      structures (including residential, commercial and industrial structures) compared with
                      $3.8 trillion to $5.5 trillion in the trendline scenario. As with the infrastructure catalyst, we also
                      apply 1.5 to 4.8 percent productivity growth assumptions in select countries in the trendline
                      scenario, and 2.5 percent annual non-automation productivity increase to remaining
                      emerging market countries in the low range of the step-up scenario.

                            Catalyst 6: Energy transitions and efficiency
                            The energy transitions driver captures the potential job creation due to the shift in mix of
                            electricity generation. The potential increase in jobs in electric power generation due to
                            increase in demand for power is captured in the utilities category of consumer spending
                            driven by rising incomes. We avoid double counting by isolating the mix shift effect in
                            this driver. Using McKinsey modeled scenarios for gigawatt (GW) capacity in 2030,
                            we multiply projected GW capacity by a jobs per GW multiplier across manufacturing,
                            decommissioning, fuels, construction/installation, operations and maintenance by energy
                            type (such as solar, coal, gas). Given the rapid and hard-to-predict changes in productivity
                            across the renewables value chain, we model a minimum scenario in which rapid
                            productivity growth continues, and a maximum scenario in which productivity gains plateau.
                            To model a step-up scenario, we increase the GW capacity shift more heavily towards
                            renewables targets that could help slow global temperature increases to two degrees
                            Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This increased shift results in greater numbers of jobs
                            created to change the energy generation mix by country.

                            We model potential spend on energy efficiency using estimates from the International
                            Energy Agency’s 2014 World energy investment outlook report. We use two scenarios
                            that the IEA models: a “New Policies Scenario” and a “450 Scenario.” In the New Policies
                            Scenario, which is grouped with our other trendline drivers, “energy demand and supply
                            projections reflect energy policies and measures that have been adopted as of early 2014,
                            as well as other commitments that have been announced, but not implemented, taking a
                            cautious view of the extent to which these may be realized.”159 For our step-up analysis, we
                            use the IEA’s 450 Scenario which “plots an emissions-reduction path for the energy sector
                            consistent with the international goal to limit the rise to long-term average temperatures to
                            two degrees Celsius.”160 In both scenarios, we use job multipliers to estimate the number of
                            incremental jobs associated with the increase in spend that the IEA projects between 2014
                            and 2030, and use indirect multipliers to capture jobs created in other supplying sectors.

                            Catalyst 7: Marketization of currently unpaid work
                            We model the marketization of currently unpaid work solely as a step-up labor demand
                            driver. We use local time-use surveys to understand the amount of time spent in various
                            countries on unpaid domestic work including cooking, cleaning, childcare and elder care.
                            We decrease the time spent on these activities in each country using a linear coefficient
                            between the minimum and maximum values across countries. We then make assumptions
                            around productivity gains in each activity through professionalization to estimate the
                            potential for new labor demand creation.




                            3. MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS
                            We used McKinsey’s Global Growth Model to dynamically model the US economy. Given
                            both the unemployment and productivity effects of automation, we use the model to
                            determine the GDP growth needed to return the economy to full employment by 2030.

                            Of the automation effects modeled, we directly included four channels by which automation
                            affects the economy: unemployment displacement, capital investment, total factor
                            productivity growth, and reemployment rate. Three of the four channels are outputs from
                            the MGI automation model. We take the unemployment displacement as the midpoint
                            displacement directly from the automation model; capital investment as the solution cost
                            given in the automation model; and total factor productivity as the implied productivity
                            growth from automation that would at the minimum result in constant total output.

                      Besides the outputs from the automation model, we also included a fourth channel,
                      the reemployment rate, which describes how displacement actually translates into
                      unemployment. Not every displaced worker will enter unemployment; some will have the
                      skills and the opportunity to quickly transition into a new role. We define the reemployment
                      rate as the percentage of displaced workers expected to return to work within the year; the
                      remaining displaced workers enter unemployment.

                      On top of the four channels, we modeled four different labor market scenarios. Each
                      of the four scenarios used a different reemployment rate—low, medium, high, or full
                      reemployment—to describe conditions such as labor market flexibility, labor market slack,
                      skills and geographic mismatch, etc. that could influence the rate at which displaced
                      workers return to work. For the United States, we used a 25 percent reemployment rate in
                      the low scenario, 49 percent reemployment rate in the medium scenario (the reemployment
                      rate of displaced workers in January 2010), 66 percent in the high scenario (the
                      reemployment rate of displaced workers in January 2016), and 100 percent reemployment
                      in the full reemployment scenario. The modeled unemployment displacement and capital
                      investment by country were held constant in all scenarios. For example, in the United
                      States, the modeled unemployment displacement was 23 percent by 2030, and expected
                      automation capital investment $145 billion by 2030. The reemployment rates for each of the
                      labor market scenarios differed by country and were estimated from literature and adjusted
                      for labor market flexibility factors.

                      The GGM first forecasts a baseline future without taking into account the effects of
                      automation. It then uses the inputted unemployment displacement, capital investment,
                      total factor productivity growth, and reemployment rate, and dynamically propagates these
                      effects of automation throughout the modeled economy. The forecasted unemployment
                      rate, GDP growth rate, and average wage rates from the GGM are to be interpreted by their
                      deviation from the baseline state as a directional range of scenarios for several possible
                      future states.




                      4. SKILLS AND WAGES ANALYSES
                      In this analysis, we look at the net impact of (i) automation and (ii) labor demand creation at
                      an occupation level, to understand which occupations could see high levels of demand vs.
                      decline by 2030.

                      Baseline for skills and wages analyses
                      The baseline for our skills and wages analyses is the 2014 employment levels by occupation,
                      adjusted for the effects of automation and our labor demand drivers. Elements of the
                      economy in which we have not sized growth (such as defense) remain at 2014 levels of
                      employment; new occupations that do not currently exist do not show in this baseline.

                      Mapping new labor demand and automation to jobs
                      Our automation modeling is mapped to each of the 820 occupation codes used by the
                      US Bureau of Labor Statistics for all of the 46 countries in our model. We multiply the
                      percentage automation adoption rate in 2030 for each occupation by the size of each
                      occupation in 2030 (which is assumed to be the same percentage of labor force as in 2014).
                      This provides us with a projection of how the employment levels in jobs will be affected by
                      automation in 2030.




138   McKinsey Global Institute     Technical appendix


                            To model the countervailing effect on labor demand creation, we map our drivers of demand
                            according to a list of associated occupations on a driver-by-driver basis. Most drivers map
                            to a specific sector, in which case we allocate incremental new jobs according to today’s
                            mix of jobs within a specified sector. In drivers that affect a narrower range of jobs, we
                            create more customized mappings to reflect reality. For example, for energy transitions and
                            efficiency, we map potential labor demand increase to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’
                            categorizations of “green jobs” and to the relevant jobs in fuels. Based on the sector of each
                            direct job added, additional indirect jobs are created based on the specified job multipliers
                            for a country. Indirect jobs are created according to the mix of their sector.

                            Combining these two calculations, we compare the total jobs displaced by automation
                            based on our 2030 baseline (today’s occupation mix, scaled in proportion with the growth
                            of labor force) to the jobs added by our drivers to 2030. To calculate a percentage growth or
                            decline, we divide this net change by today’s employment level for the occupation.

                            Skills and educational categorizations
                            Our analyses take training requirements for jobs as a proxy for skill requirements. The five
                            educational categories used in our analyses are: less than secondary, secondary, associate
                            degree, bachelor’s degree and advanced degree. These classifications map to the five
                            job-zones defined by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ O*Net and take into account
                            educational degrees, amount of training required, and years of experience necessary in
                            order to qualify for a given job. Associate degrees are more common in the United States
                            than in the rest of the world and usually require two years of study.

                            To optimize for consistency across our modeling and data quality, we use these educational
                            requirements from the O*Net classification across all 46 countries. This simplifying
                            assumption is limiting in cases in which there are discrepancies among countries, but we
                            find that requirements are broadly similar: the educational requirement to be a doctor is
                            typically an advanced degree in most countries.

                            Wage assumptions
                            In our analyses on the effects of automation and new labor demand on wages, we keep
                            wages constant at 2014 levels; chemical engineers, economists and lawyers were in the
                            highest decile of wage earners in 2014 in the United States, where they remain for our
                            analyses in 2030.

                            In reality, we would expect wages to adjust to shifts in response to automation and new
                            labor demand. There could also be additional economic effects on wages, such as
                            Baumol’s cost disease, or policy effects such as minimum wage legislation. Modeling
                            these effects on wages is beyond the scope of our analysis, so we exclude them in favor of
                            keeping wages constant at 2014 levels. While we thus cannot say anything definitive about
                            wage shifts and are limited in any commentary on inequality, our approach allows us to
                            identify relative shifts between high-wage and low-wage occupations.

Exhibit A2

Glossary of automation technologies and techniques                                                                                  OCTOBER 2017
This list is not comprehensive but is meant to illustrate some of the technologies and techniques
that are being developed to enable automation of different work activities

 Technologies
 and techniques          Description/examples
 Artificial              Field of computer science specializing in developing systems that exhibit “intelligence.” Often
 intelligence            abbreviated as AI, the term was coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the
                         first conference devoted to this topic

                         Machine             Subfield of artificial intelligence developing systems that “learn,” i.e., practitioners
                         learning            “train” these systems rather than “programming” them

                         Supervised          Machine learning techniques that train a system to respond appropriately to stimuli by
                         learning            providing a training set of sample input and desired output pairs. Supervised learning
                                             has been used for email spam detection by training systems on a large number of
                                             emails, each of which has been manually labeled as either being spam or not

                         Transfer            Subfield of machine learning developing systems that store knowledge gained while
                         learning            solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. Often used
                                             when the training set for one problem is small, but the training data for a related
                                             problem is plentiful, e.g., repurposing a deep learning system trained on a large non-

                         learning            artificial neurons. Prior to deep learning, artificial neural networks often only had three
                                             layers and dozens of neurons; deep learning networks often have seven to ten or more
